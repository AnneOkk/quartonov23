	abstract = {In light of the {NIMH}'s Research Domain Criteria ({RDoC}), the advent of functional neuroimaging, novel technologies and methods provide new opportunities to develop precise and personalized prognosis and diagnosis of mental disorders. Machine learning ({ML}) and artificial intelligence ({AI}) technologies are playing an increasingly critical role in the new era of precision psychiatry. Combining {ML}/{AI} with neuromodulation technologies can potentially provide explainable solutions in clinical practice and effective therapeutic treatment. Advanced wearable and mobile technologies also call for the new role of {ML}/{AI} for digital phenotyping in mobile mental health. In this review, we provide a comprehensive review of the {ML} methodologies and applications by combining neuroimaging, neuromodulation, and advanced mobile technologies in psychiatry practice. Additionally, we review the role of {ML} in molecular phenotyping and cross-species biomarker identification in precision psychiatry. We further discuss explainable {AI} ({XAI}) and causality testing in a closed-human-in-the-loop manner, and highlight the {ML} potential in multimedia information extraction and multimodal data fusion. Finally, we discuss conceptual and practical challenges in precision psychiatry and highlight {ML} opportunities in future research.},

	abstract = {Social distancing and the shortage of healthcare professionals during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, the impact of population aging on the healthcare system, as well as the rapid pace of digital innovation are catalyzing the development and implementation of new technologies and digital services in psychiatry. Is this transformation a blessing or a curse for psychiatry? To answer this question, we conducted a literature review covering a broad range of new technologies and {eHealth} services, including telepsychiatry; computer-, internet-, and app-based cognitive behavioral therapy; virtual reality; digital applied games; a digital medicine system; omics; neuroimaging; machine learning; precision psychiatry; clinical decision support; electronic health records; physician charting; digital language translators; and online mental health resources for patients. We found that {eHealth} services provide effective, scalable, and cost-efficient options for the treatment of people with limited or no access to mental health care. This review highlights innovative technologies spearheading the way to more effective and safer treatments. We identified artificially intelligent tools that relieve physicians from routine tasks, allowing them to focus on collaborative doctor–patient relationships. The transformation of traditional clinics into digital ones is outlined, and the challenges associated with the successful deployment of digitalization in psychiatry are highlighted.},

	abstract = {Despite enormous enthusiasm, machine learning models are rarely translated into clinical care and there is minimal evidence of clinical or economic impact. New conference venues and academic journals have emerged to promote the proliferating research; however, the translational path remains unclear. This review undertakes the first in-depth study to identify how machine learning models that ingest structured electronic health record data can be applied to clinical decision support tasks and translated into clinical practice. The authors complement their own work with the experience of 21 machine learning products that address problems across clinical domains and across geographic populations. Four phases of translation emerge: design and develop, evaluate and validate, diffuse and scale, and continuing monitoring and maintenance. The review highlights the varying approaches taken across each phase by teams building machine learning products and presents a discussion of challenges and opportunities. The translational path and associated findings are instructive to researchers and developers building machine learning products, policy makers regulating machine learning products, and health system leaders who are considering adopting a machine learning product.},

This scoping review paper aims to broadly explore the nature of research activity using {ML} in the context of psychological talk therapies, highlighting the scope of current methods and considerations for clinical practice and directions for future research. Using a systematic search methodology, fifty-one studies were identified. A narrative synthesis indicates two types of studies, those who developed and tested an {ML} model (k=44), and those who reported on the feasibility of a particular treatment tool that uses an {ML} algorithm (k=7). Most model development studies used supervised learning techniques to classify or predict labeled treatment process or outcome data, whereas others used unsupervised techniques to identify clusters in the unlabeled patient or treatment data. Overall, the current applications of {ML} in psychotherapy research demonstrated a range of possible benefits for indications of treatment process, adherence, therapist skills and treatment response prediction, as well as ways to accelerate research through automated behavioral or linguistic process coding.

              Background
              Artificial intelligence ({AI}) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of {AI} in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.
            
            
              Main body
              Key challenges for the translation of {AI} systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of {AI} systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of {AI} algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The safe and timely translation of {AI} research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.},

App store descriptions therefore represent a key channel to inform consumer choice. This study examined the claims invoked through these app store descriptions, the extent to which scientific language is used to support such claims, and the corresponding evidence in the literature. Google Play and {iTunes} were searched for apps related to depression, self-harm, substance use, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The descriptions of the top-ranking, consumer-focused apps were coded to identify claims of acceptability and effectiveness, and forms of supporting statement. For apps which invoked ostensibly scientific principles, a literature search was conducted to assess their credibility. Seventy-three apps were coded, and the majority (64\%) claimed effectiveness at diagnosing a mental health condition, or improving symptoms, mood or self-management. Scientific language was most frequently used to support these effectiveness claims (44\%), although this included techniques not validated by literature searches (8/24 = 33\%). Two apps described low-quality, primary evidence to support the use of the app. Only one app included a citation to published literature. A minority of apps (14\%) described design or development involving lived experience, and none referenced certification or accreditation processes such as app libraries. Scientific language was the most frequently invoked form of support for use of mental health apps; however, high-quality evidence is not commonly described. Improved knowledge translation strategies may improve the adoption of other strategies, such as certification or lived experience co-design.},

	abstract = {Objectives To assess undergraduate medical students’ attitudes towards artificial intelligence ({AI}) in radiology and medicine. Materials and methods Aweb-based questionnaire was designed using {SurveyMonkey}, and was sent out to students at three major medical schools. It consisted of various sections aiming to evaluate the students’ prior knowledge of {AI} in radiology and beyond, as well as their attitude towards {AI} in radiology specifically and in medicine in general. Respondents’ anonymity was ensured.
Results A total of 263 students (166 female, 94 male, median age 23 years) responded to the questionnaire. Around 52\% were aware of the ongoing discussion about {AI} in radiology and 68\% stated that they were unaware of the technologies involved. Respondents agreed that {AI} could potentially detect pathologies in radiological examinations (83\%) but felt that {AI} would not be able to establish a definite diagnosis (56\%). The majority agreed that {AI} will revolutionise and improve radiology (77\% and 86\%), while disagreeing with statements that human radiologists will be replaced (83\%). Over two-thirds agreed on the need for {AI} to be included in medical training (71\%). In sub-group analyses male and tech-savvy respondents were more confident on the benefits of {AI} and less fearful of these technologies.
Conclusion Contrary to anecdotes published in the media, undergraduate medical students do not worry that {AI} will replace human radiologists, and are aware of the potential applications and implications of {AI} on radiology and medicine. Radiology should take the lead in educating students about these emerging technologies.},

	abstract = {We examined how individuals’ personality relates to various attitudes toward artificial intelligence ({AI}). Attitudes were organized into two dimensions of affective components (positive and negative emotions) and two dimensions of cognitive components (sociality and functionality). For personality, we focused on the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness) and personal innovativeness in information technology. Based on a survey of 1,530 South Korean adults, we found that extraversion was related to negative emotions and low functionality. Agreeableness was associated with both positive and negative emotions, and it was positively associated with sociality and functionality. Conscientiousness was negatively related to negative emotions, and it was associated with high functionality, but also with low sociality. Neuroticism was related to negative emotions, but also to high sociality. Openness was positively linked to functionality, but did not predict other attitudes when other proximal predictors were included (e.g. prior use, personal innovativeness). Personal innovativeness in information technology consistently showed positive attitudes toward {AI} across all four dimensions. These findings provide mixed support for our hypotheses, and we discuss specific implications for future research and practice.},

	abstract = {Purpose Job demands can contribute to nurses’ turnover intention and this can have an impact on health services among the general population. It appears important to identify the work environment factors associated with turnover intention, as well as the psychological resources liable to act on this relationship. Drawing on self-determination theory ({SDT}), the purpose of this study (n=1179) is to investigate the relationship between two job demands (role ambiguity and role conflict) and turnover intention, as well as the moderating role of basic need satisfaction (autonomy, competence and relatedness) within these relationships. Design/methodology/approach This cross-sectional study was conducted among nurses (Québec, Canada). Nurses completed an online questionnaire. To test the proposed moderating effect of satisfaction of the three psychological needs (i.e. autonomy, competence and relatedness) in the relationship between job demands (i.e. role ambiguity and role conflict) and turnover intention, path analysis was conducted using Mplus v.8 (Muthén and Muthen, 2017). Two models, one for each demand, were tested. Findings As expected, role ambiguity and role conflict are positively related to turnover intention. Results reveal a significant interaction between role ambiguity and satisfaction of the need for autonomy in the prediction of turnover intention. The satisfaction of the need for competence and the satisfaction of the need for relatedness did not moderate the relationship between role ambiguity and turnover intention. Satisfaction of the need for autonomy moderated the relationship between role conflict and turnover intention. Moreover, results revealed a significant interaction between role conflict and satisfaction of the need for competence in the prediction of turnover intention. Satisfaction of the need for relatedness did not moderate the relationship between role conflict and turnover intention. Research limitations/implications The results align with the theoretical propositions of several leading theories in occupational health which state that workers’ psychological functioning derives not only from the job characteristics of their work environment, but also from the psychological resources at their disposal. The study contributes to {SDT}. First, to date, this is the first study to investigate basic psychological need satisfaction as a moderator in the relationship between contextual factors and workers’ functioning. Second, the findings revealed the importance of assessing psychological needs separately, as each contributes in a specific way to workers’ work-related attitudes and adaptation to their professional environment. Practical implications Perceptions of autonomy and competence act as key psychological resources for nurses. Managerial support for autonomy (e.g. providing nurses with meaningful information regarding their work) and competence (e.g. providing nurses with frequent positive feedback regarding their work efforts) constitutes a series of key management practices that can foster perceptions of autonomy and competence. The findings show that two role stressors predict nurses’ turnover intention. As such, health care establishments are encouraged to focus on interventions that reduce uncertainties and conflicting situations from nurses (provide clear job descriptions and effective communication). Social implications By promoting a sense of effectiveness and feelings of self-endorsement at work, health care establishments can reduce nurses’ turnover intention and help prevent staffing shortages among this important work group. Originality/value Although past research shows that workers’ motivational profile can modulate the relationship between characteristics within the work environment and workers’ functioning, studying the quality of work motivation is not sufficient to completely understand the factors that can influence workers’ reactions to job demands. Need satisfaction is crucial to the development and maintenance of high quality motivation. Evaluating need satisfaction as a moderator in the stressor–strain relationship could offer a better understanding of the psychological experiences that can promote workers’ adaptation to their work environment. To date, no study has investigated the buffering role of psychological needs in the stressor–strain relationship.},

Of 24,000 {ESR} members contacted, 675 (2.8\%) completed the survey, 454 males (67\%), 555 (82\%) working at academic/public hospitals. {AI} impact was mostly expected (≥ 30\% of responders) on breast, oncologic, thoracic, and neuro imaging, mainly involving mammography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance. Responders foresee {AI} impact on: job opportunities (375/675, 56\%), 218/375 (58\%) expecting increase, 157/375 (42\%) reduction; reporting workload (504/675, 75\%), 256/504 (51\%) expecting reduction, 248/504 (49\%) increase; radiologist’s profile, becoming more clinical (364/675, 54\%) and more subspecialised (283/675, 42\%). For 374/675 responders (55\%) {AI}-only reports would be not accepted by patients, for 79/675 (12\%) accepted, for 222/675 (33\%) it is too early to answer. For 275/675 responders (41\%) {AI} will make the radiologist-patient relation more interactive, for 140/675 (21\%) more impersonal, for 259/675 (38\%) unchanged. If {AI} allows time saving, radiologists should interact more with clinicians (437/675, 65\%) and/or patients (322/675, 48\%).

Of 675 responders, 321 (48\%) do not currently use {AI}, 138 (20\%) use {AI}, 205 (30\%) are planning to do it. According to 277/675 responders (41\%), radiologists will take responsibility for {AI} outcome, while 277/675 (41\%) suggest shared responsibility with other professionals.

	abstract = {Objectives
We investigated the attitudes of radiologists, information technology ({IT}) specialists, and industry representatives on artificial intelligence ({AI}) and its future impact on radiological work.

Materials and Methods
During a national meeting for {AI}, {eHealth}, and {IT} infrastructure in 2019, we conducted a survey to obtain participants’ attitudes. A total of 123 participants completed 28 items exploring {AI} usage in medicine. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify differences between radiologists, {IT} specialists, and industry representatives.

Results
The strongest agreement between all respondents occurred with the following: plausibility checks are important to understand the decisions of the {AI} (93\% agreement), validation of {AI} algorithms is mandatory (91\%), and medicine becomes more efficient in the age of {AI} (86\%). In contrast, only 25\% of the respondents had confidence in the {AI} results, and only 17\% believed that medicine will become more human through the use of {AI}. The answers were significantly different between the three professions for four items: relevance for protocol selection in cross-sectional imaging (p = 0.034), medical societies should be involved in validation (p = 0.028), patients should be informed about the use of {AI} (p = 0.047), and {AI} should be part of medical education (p = 0.026).

Conclusion
Currently, a discrepancy exists between high expectations for the future role of {AI} and low confidence in the results. This attitude was similar across all three groups. The demand for plausibility checks and the need to prove the usefulness in randomized controlled studies indicate what is needed in future research.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes and perceptions of Turkish dental students towards {AI} and to provide information about their opinions to use of {AI} in dentistry. Methods A 22-question survey was distributed through Google Forms to all dental students at 9 Turkish dental schools in March 2019. It consisted of various sections aiming to evaluate the dental students’ knowledge and attitudes toward {AI} and possible applications in dentistry. Respondents’ anonymity was ensured. Results A total of 1103 students (650 female, 453 male; mean age was 21.36 ± 1.93 years) responded to the questionnaire for a 21.69\% response rate. Of these, about 48.40\% had basic knowledge about {AI} technologies and 10.6\% stated that they had no information sources about {AI}. 85.70\% agreed that dentistry would be revolutionized by {AI} but 28.60\% did not agree that {AI} could replace themselves in the near future. In addition, 74.60\% and 79.80\% of agreed on topics about {AI} to be included in undergraduate and postgraduate dental education, respectively. Conclusions Although participants have insufficient knowledge of {AI}, they are willing to improve their knowledge in this field. Participants shared an optimistic views and thought that {AI} will have a positive impact on dental future practice. Follow-up surveys and multinational studies should be conducted to further explore these issues.},

	abstract = {High prevalence of mental illness and the need for effective mental health care, combined with recent advances in {AI}, has led to an increase in explorations of how the field of machine learning ({ML}) can assist in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems. {ML} techniques can potentially offer new routes for learning patterns of human behavior; identifying mental health symptoms and risk factors; developing predictions about disease progression; and personalizing and optimizing therapies. Despite the potential opportunities for using {ML} within mental health, this is an emerging research area, and the development of effective {ML}-enabled applications that are implementable in practice is bound up with an array of complex, interwoven challenges. Aiming to guide future research and identify new directions for advancing development in this important domain, this article presents an introduction to, and a systematic review of, current {ML} work regarding psycho-socially based mental health conditions from the computing and {HCI} literature.

	abstract = {Background: Machine learning systems are part of the field of artificial intelligence that automatically learn models from data to make better decisions. Natural language processing ({NLP}), by using corpora and learning approaches, provides good performance in statistical tasks, such as text classification or sentiment mining.
Objective: The primary aim of this systematic review was to summarize and characterize, in methodological and technical terms, studies that used machine learning and {NLP} techniques for mental health. The secondary aim was to consider the potential use of these methods in mental health clinical practice
Methods: This systematic review follows the {PRISMA} (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines and is registered with {PROSPERO} (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; number {CRD}42019107376). The search was conducted using 4 medical databases ({PubMed}, Scopus, {ScienceDirect}, and {PsycINFO}) with the following keywords: machine learning, data mining, psychiatry, mental health, and mental disorder. The exclusion criteria were as follows: languages other than English, anonymization process, case studies, conference papers, and reviews. No limitations on publication dates were imposed.
Results: A total of 327 articles were identified, of which 269 (82.3\%) were excluded and 58 (17.7\%) were included in the review. The results were organized through a qualitative perspective. Although studies had heterogeneous topics and methods, some themes emerged. Population studies could be grouped into 3 categories: patients included in medical databases, patients who came to the emergency room, and social media users. The main objectives were to extract symptoms, classify severity of illness, compare therapy effectiveness, provide psychopathological clues, and challenge the current nosography. Medical records and social media were the 2 major data sources. With regard to the methods used, preprocessing used the standard methods of {NLP} and unique identifier extraction dedicated to medical texts. Efficient classifiers were preferred rather than transparent functioning classifiers. Python was the most frequently used platform.
Conclusions: Machine learning and {NLP} models have been highly topical issues in medicine in recent years and may be considered a new paradigm in medical research. However, these processes tend to confirm clinical hypotheses rather than developing entirely new information, and only one major category of the population (ie, social media users) is an imprecise cohort. Moreover, some language-specific features can improve the performance of {NLP} methods, and their extension to other languages should be more closely investigated. However, machine learning and {NLP} techniques provide useful information from unexplored data (ie, patients’ daily habits that are usually inaccessible to care providers). Before considering It as an additional tool of mental health care, ethical issues remain and should be discussed in a timely manner. Machine learning and {NLP} methods may offer multiple perspectives in mental health research but should also be considered as tools to support clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Objective

Enhanced technology in computer and internet has driven scale and quality of data to be improved in various areas including healthcare sectors. Machine Learning ({ML}) has played a pivotal role in efficiently analyzing those big data, but a general misunderstanding of {ML} algorithms still exists in applying them (e.g., {ML} techniques can settle a problem of small sample size, or deep learning is the {ML} algorithm). This paper reviewed the research of diagnosing mental illness using {ML} algorithm and suggests how {ML} techniques can be employed and worked in practice.


Methods

Researches about mental illness diagnostic using {ML} techniques were carefully reviewed. Five traditional {ML} algorithms-Support Vector Machines ({SVM}), Gradient Boosting Machine ({GBM}), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighborhood ({KNN})-frequently used for mental health area researches were systematically organized and summarized.


Results

Based on literature review, it turned out that Support Vector Machines ({SVM}), Gradient Boosting Machine ({GBM}), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighborhood ({KNN}) were frequently employed in mental health area, but many researchers did not clarify the reason for using their {ML} algorithm though every {ML} algorithm has its own advantages. In addition, there were several studies to apply {ML} algorithms without fully understanding the data characteristics.


Conclusion

Researchers using {ML} algorithms should be aware of the properties of their {ML} algorithms and the limitation of the results they obtained under restricted data conditions. This paper provides useful information of the properties and limitation of each {ML} algorithm in the practice of mental health.},

              In total 37 students responded (response rate: 37/120, 31\%). Among respondents, 73\% ( 
              n 
              = 27) intended to enter a mental health profession, and 97\% reported that they had heard of the term “machine learning.” Students estimated 0.52\% of their program would be spent on {AI}/{ML} education. Around half (46\%) reported that they intended to learn about {AI}/{ML} as it pertained to mental health care. On 5-point Likert scale, students “moderately agreed” (median = 4) that {AI}/M should be part of clinical psychology/psychotherapy education. Qualitative analysis of students' comments resulted in four major themes on the impact of {AI}/{ML} on mental healthcare: (1) Changes in the quality and understanding of psychotherapy care; (2) Impact on patient-therapist interactions; (3) Impact on the psychotherapy profession; (4) Data management and ethical issues. 
             
             
              Conclusions: 
              This pilot study found that postgraduate clinical psychology students held a wide range of opinions but had limited formal education on how {AI}/{ML}-enabled tools might impact psychotherapy. The survey raises questions about how curricula could be enhanced to educate clinical psychology/psychotherapy trainees about the scope of {AI}/{ML} in mental healthcare.},

This study investigated to what extent psychology students currently accept and use {AI} and what affects their perception and usage. Therefore, an {AI} acceptance model based on established technology acceptance models was developed and tested in a sample of 218 psychology students.

In this way, possible restraints regarding the use of {AI} can be reduced and its beneficial opportunities exploited in psychological contexts.},

              Objectives 
              Radiologists’ perception is likely to influence the adoption of artificial intelligence ({AI}) into clinical practice. We investigated knowledge and attitude towards {AI} by radiologists and residents in Europe and beyond. 
             
             
              Methods 
              Between April and July 2019, a survey on fear of replacement, knowledge, and attitude towards {AI} was accessible to radiologists and residents. The survey was distributed through several radiological societies, author networks, and social media. Independent predictors of fear of replacement and a positive attitude towards {AI} were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. 
             
             
              Results 
               
                The survey was completed by 1,041 respondents from 54 mostly European countries. Most respondents were male ( 
                n 
                = 670, 65\%), median age was 38 (24–74) years, 
                n 
                = 142 (35\%) residents, and 
                n 
                = 471 (45\%) worked in an academic center. Basic {AI}-specific knowledge was associated with fear (adjusted {OR} 1.56, 95\% {CI} 1.10–2.21, 
                p 
                = 0.01), while intermediate {AI}-specific knowledge (adjusted {OR} 0.40, 95\% {CI} 0.20–0.80, 
                p 
                = 0.01) or advanced {AI}-specific knowledge (adjusted {OR} 0.43, 95\% {CI} 0.21–0.90, 
                p 
                = 0.03) was inversely associated with fear. A positive attitude towards {AI} was observed in 48\% ( 
                n 
                = 501) and was associated with only having heard of {AI}, intermediate (adjusted {OR} 11.65, 95\% {CI} 4.25–31.92, 
                p 
                {\textless} 0.001), or advanced {AI}-specific knowledge (adjusted {OR} 17.65, 95\% {CI} 6.16–50.54, 
                p 
                {\textless} 0.001). 
               
             
             
              Conclusions 
              Limited {AI}-specific knowledge levels among radiology residents and radiologists are associated with fear, while intermediate to advanced {AI}-specific knowledge levels are associated with a positive attitude towards {AI}. Additional training may therefore improve clinical adoption. 
             
             
              Key Points 
               
                • Forty-eight percent of radiologists and residents have an open and proactive attitude towards artificial intelligence ({AI}), while 38\% fear of replacement by {AI}. 
               
               
                • Intermediate and advanced {AI}-specific knowledge levels may enhance adoption of {AI} in clinical practice, while rudimentary knowledge levels appear to be inhibitive. 
               
               
                • {AI} should be incorporated in radiology training curricula to help facilitate its clinical adoption.},

              Objectives 
              Currently, hurdles to implementation of artificial intelligence ({AI}) in radiology are a much-debated topic but have not been investigated in the community at large. Also, controversy exists if and to what extent {AI} should be incorporated into radiology residency programs. 
             
             
              Methods 
              Between April and July 2019, an international survey took place on {AI} regarding its impact on the profession and training. The survey was accessible for radiologists and residents and distributed through several radiological societies. Relationships of independent variables with opinions, hurdles, and education were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. 
             
             
              Results 
               
                The survey was completed by 1041 respondents from 54 countries. A majority ( 
                n 
                = 855, 82\%) expects that {AI} will cause a change to the radiology field within 10 years. Most frequently, expected roles of {AI} in clinical practice were second reader ( 
                n 
                = 829, 78\%) and work-flow optimization ( 
                n 
                = 802, 77\%). Ethical and legal issues ( 
                n 
                = 630, 62\%) and lack of knowledge ( 
                n 
                = 584, 57\%) were mentioned most often as hurdles to implementation. Expert respondents added lack of labelled images and generalizability issues. A majority ( 
                n 
                = 819, 79\%) indicated that {AI} should be incorporated in residency programs, while less support for imaging informatics and {AI} as a subspecialty was found ( 
                n 
                = 241, 23\%). 
               
             
             
              Conclusions 
              Broad community demand exists for incorporation of {AI} into residency programs. Based on the results of the current study, integration of {AI} education seems advisable for radiology residents, including issues related to data management, ethics, and legislation. 
             
             
              Key Points 
               
                • There is broad demand from the radiological community to incorporate {AI} into residency programs, but there is less support to recognize imaging informatics as a radiological subspecialty 
                . 
               
               
                • Ethical and legal issues and lack of knowledge are recognized as major bottlenecks for {AI} implementation by the radiological community, while the shortage in labeled data and {IT}-infrastructure issues are less often recognized as hurdles 
                . 
               
               
                • Integrating {AI} education in radiology curricula including technical aspects of data management, risk of bias, and ethical and legal issues may aid successful integration of {AI} into diagnostic radiology

              Background 
              It is unlikely that applications of artificial intelligence ({AI}) will completely replace physicians. However, it is very likely that {AI} applications will acquire many of their roles and generate new tasks in medical care. To be ready for new roles and tasks, medical students and physicians will need to understand the fundamentals of {AI} and data science, mathematical concepts, and related ethical and medico-legal issues in addition with the standard medical principles. Nevertheless, there is no valid and reliable instrument available in the literature to measure medical {AI} readiness. In this study, we have described the development of a valid and reliable psychometric measurement tool for the assessment of the perceived readiness of medical students on {AI} technologies and its applications in medicine. 
             
             
              Methods 
              To define medical students’ required competencies on {AI}, a diverse set of experts’ opinions were obtained by a qualitative method and were used as a theoretical framework, while creating the item pool of the scale. Exploratory Factor Analysis ({EFA}) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis ({CFA}) were applied. 
             
             
              Results 
               
                A total of 568 medical students during the {EFA} phase and 329 medical students during the {CFA} phase, enrolled in two different public universities in Turkey participated in this study. The initial 27-items finalized with a 22-items scale in a four-factor structure (cognition, ability, vision, and ethics), which explains 50.9\% cumulative variance that resulted from the {EFA}. Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient was 0.87. {CFA} indicated appropriate fit of the four-factor model ( 
                χ

              Conclusions 
              The newly developed Medical Artificial Intelligence Readiness Scale for Medical Students ({MAIRS}-{MS}) was found to be valid and reliable tool for evaluation and monitoring of perceived readiness levels of medical students on {AI} technologies and applications. 
              Medical schools may follow ‘a physician training perspective that is compatible with {AI} in medicine’ to their curricula by using {MAIRS}-{MS}. This scale could be benefitted by medical and health science education institutions as a valuable curriculum development tool with its learner needs assessment and participants’ end-course perceived readiness opportunities.},

Generally, theory of planned behavior, technology acceptance model, diffusion of innovation theory and unified theory of technology acceptance cover the most distinguished concepts and constructs to understand attitudes towards technological innovations. Influencing factors may differ for health care professionals and patients. While perceived benefits of technological innovations may be the most distinctive factor for health care professionals, ease of use is of big importance for patients. Perceived ease of use is affected by personal norms and perceived control beliefs. Suspicions of confidentiality and privacy are strong influencing factors for refusing technology usage for patients. Considering all these factors are necessary while designing intervention programs to enhance technology acceptance in health care.

	abstract = {Background 
              The use of artificial intelligence ({AI}) in medicine will generate numerous application possibilities to improve patient care, provide real-time data analytics, and enable continuous patient monitoring. Clinicians and health informaticians should become familiar with machine learning and deep learning. Additionally, they should have a strong background in data analytics and data visualization to use, evaluate, and develop {AI} applications in clinical practice. 
             
             
              Objective 
              The main objective of this study was to evaluate the current state of {AI} training and the use of {AI} tools to enhance the learning experience. 
             
             
              Methods 
              A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to analyze the use of {AI} in medical and health informatics education, and to evaluate existing {AI} training practices. {PRISMA}-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols) guidelines were followed. The studies that focused on the use of {AI} tools to enhance medical education and the studies that investigated teaching {AI} as a new competency were categorized separately to evaluate recent developments.

              Objectives 
              To explore the attitudes of United Kingdom ({UK}) medical students regarding artificial intelligence ({AI}), their understanding, and career intention towards radiology. We also examine the state of education relating to {AI} amongst this cohort. 
             
             
              Methods 
              {UK} medical students were invited to complete an anonymous electronic survey consisting of Likert and dichotomous questions. 
             
             
              Results 
               
                Four hundred eighty-four responses were received from 19 {UK} medical schools. Eighty-eight percent of students believed that {AI} will play an important role in healthcare, and 49\% reported they were less likely to consider a career in radiology due to {AI}. Eighty-nine percent of students believed that teaching in {AI} would be beneficial for their careers, and 78\% agreed that students should receive training in {AI} as part of their medical degree. Only 45 students received any teaching on {AI}; none of the students received such teaching as part of their compulsory curriculum. Statistically, students that did receive teaching in {AI} were more likely to consider radiology ( 
                p 
                 = 0.01) and rated more positively to the questions relating to the perceived competence in the post-graduation use of {AI} ( 
                p 
                 = 0.01–0.04); despite this, a large proportion of students in the taught group reported a lack of confidence and understanding required for the critical use of healthcare {AI} tools. 
               
             
             
              Conclusions 
              {UK} medical students understand the importance of {AI} and are keen to engage. Medical school training on {AI} should be expanded and improved. Realistic use cases and limitations of {AI} must be presented to students so they will not feel discouraged from pursuing radiology.},

	abstract = {Background: Since the advent of artificial intelligence ({AI}) in 1955, the applications of {AI} have increased over the years within a rapidly changing digital landscape where public expectations are on the rise, fed by social media, industry leaders, and medical practitioners. However, there has been little interest in {AI} in medical education until the last two decades, with only a recent increase in the number of publications and citations in the field. To our knowledge, thus far, a limited number of articles have discussed or reviewed the current use of {AI} in medical education. Objective: This study aims to review the current applications of {AI} in medical education as well as the challenges of implementing {AI} in medical education. Methods: Medline (Ovid), {EBSCOhost} Education Resources Information Center ({ERIC}) and Education Source, and Web of Science were searched with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full text of the selected articles was analyzed using the Extension of Technology Acceptance Model and the Diffusions of Innovations theory. Data were subsequently pooled together and analyzed quantitatively. Results: A total of 37 articles were identified. Three primary uses of {AI} in medical education were identified: learning support (n=32), assessment of students’ learning (n=4), and curriculum review (n=1). The main reasons for use of {AI} are its ability to provide feedback and a guided learning pathway and to decrease costs. Subgroup analysis revealed that medical undergraduates are the primary target audience for {AI} use. In addition, 34 articles described the challenges of {AI} implementation in medical education; two main reasons were identified: difficulty in assessing the effectiveness of {AI} in medical education and technical challenges while developing {AI} applications. Conclusions: The primary use of {AI} in medical education was for learning support mainly due to its ability to provide individualized feedback. Little emphasis was placed on curriculum review and assessment of students’ learning due to the lack of digitalization and sensitive nature of examinations, respectively. Big data manipulation also warrants the need to ensure data integrity. Methodological improvements are required to increase {AI} adoption by addressing the technical difficulties of creating an {AI} application and using novel methods to assess the effectiveness of {AI}. To better integrate {AI} into the medical profession, measures should be taken to introduce {AI} into the medical school curriculum for medical professionals to better understand {AI} algorithms and maximize its use.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Machine learning capability holds promise to inform disease models, the discovery and development of novel disease modifying therapeutics and prevention strategies in psychiatry. Herein, we provide an introduction on how machine learning/Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) may instantiate such capabilities, as well as provide rationale for its application to psychiatry in both research and clinical ecosystems.
Methods
Databases {PubMed} and {PsycINFO} were searched from 1966 to June 2016 for keywords:Big Data, Machine Learning, Precision Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, Mental Health, Mental Disease, Psychiatry, Data Mining, {RDoC}, and Research Domain Criteria. Articles selected for review were those that were determined to be aligned with the objective of this particular paper.
Results
Results indicate that {AI} is a viable option to build useful predictors of outcome while offering objective and comparable accuracy metrics, a unique opportunity, particularly in mental health research. The approach has also consistently brought notable insight into disease models through processing the vast amount of already available multi-domain, semi-structured medical data. The opportunity for {AI} in psychiatry, in addition to disease-model refinement, is in characterizing those at risk, and it is likely also relevant to personalizing and discovering therapeutics.
Conclusions
Machine learning currently provides an opportunity to parse disease models in complex, multi-factorial disease states (e.g. mental disorders) and could possibly inform treatment selection with existing therapies and provide bases for domain-based therapeutic discovery.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.03.002},
	abstract = {Background
Although telehealth offers an improved approach to providing healthcare services, its adoption by end users remains slow. With an older population as the main target, these traditionally conservative users pose a big challenge to the successful implementation of innovative telehealth services.
Objectives
The objective of this study was to develop and empirically test a model for predicting the factors affecting older users’ acceptance of Home Telehealth Services ({HTS}).
Methods
A survey instrument was administered to 400 participants aged 50 years and above from both rural and urban environments in Slovenia. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the causal effect of seven hypothesized predicting factors. {HTS} were introduced as a bundle of functionalities, representing future services that currently do not exist. This enabled users’ perceptions to be measured on the conceptual level, rather than attitudes to a specific technical solution.
Results
Six relevant predictors were confirmed in older users’ {HTS} acceptance behavior, with Performance Expectancy (r=0.30), Effort Expectancy (r=0.49), Facilitating Conditions (r=0.12), and Perceived Security (r=0.16) having a direct impact on behavioral intention to use {HTS}. In addition, Computer Anxiety is positioned as an antecedent of Effort Expectancy with a strong negative influence (r=−0.61), and Doctor’s Opinion influence showed a strong impact on Performance Expectancy (r=0.31). The results also indicate Social Influence as an irrelevant predictor of acceptance behavior. The model of six predictors yielded 77\% of the total variance explained in the final measured Behavioral Intention to Use {HTS} by older adults.
Conclusion
The level at which {HTS} are perceived as easy to use and manage is the leading acceptance predictor in older users’ {HTS} acceptance. Together with Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Security, these three factors represent the key influence on older people’s {HTS} acceptance behavior. When promoting {HTS}, interventions should focus to portray it as secure. Marketing interventions should focus also on promoting {HTS} among health professionals, using them as social agents to frame the services as useful and beneficial. The important role of computer anxiety may result in a need to use different equipment such as a tablet computer to access {HTS}. Finally, this paper introduces important methodological guidelines for measuring perceptions on a conceptual level of future services that currently do not exist.},

	shorttitle = {Understanding factors influencing the adoption of {mHealth} by the elderly},
	abstract = {Background
{mHealth} (mobile health) services are becoming an increasingly important form of information and communication technology ({ICT}) enabled delivery for healthcare, especially in low-resource environments such as developing countries like Bangladesh. Despite widespread adoption of mobile phones and the acknowledged potential of using them to improve healthcare services, the adoption and acceptance of this technology among the elderly is significantly low. However, little research has been done to draw any systematic study of the elderly’s intention to adopt {mHealth} services.
Objective
The aim of this study was to develop a theoretical model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology ({UTAUT}) and then empirically test it for determining the key factors influencing elderly users’ intention to adopt and use the {mHealth} services.
Methods
A face-to-face structured questionnaire survey method was used to collect data from nearly 300 participants of age 60 years and above from the capital city of Bangladesh. The data were analyzed using the Partial Least Squares ({PLS}) method, a statistical analysis technique based upon Structural Equation Modeling ({SEM}).
Results
The study determined that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, technology anxiety, and resistance to change (p{\textless}0.05) had a significant impact on the users’ behavioral intention to adopt {mHealth} services. The study, however, revealed no significant relation between the facilitating condition and the users’ behavioral intention to use the {mHealth} services (p{\textgreater}0.05).
Conclusions
This study confirms the applicability of {UTAUT} model in the context of {mHealth} services among the elderly in developing countries like Bangladesh. It provides valuable information for {mHealth} service providers and policy makers in understanding the adoption challenges and the issues and also provides practical guidance for the successful implementation of {mHealth} services. Additionally the empirical findings identify implications related to the design and development of {mHealth} services that influence potential users. Furthermore, due to a generic approach, the findings of this study could be easily modified to assist other developing countries in the planning and up-take of {mHealth} services.},

	abstract = {Payment transaction is now experiencing revolution as the rapid advancement of financial technology system. There is growing usage of e-money as a mean of payment in Indonesia. Besides, there is also a growing concern on the ethical aspect of e-money from an Islamic perspective, that is riba or usury. Previous studies have examined customers' behavioral intention to use e-money by implementing Theory of Planned Behavior ({TPB}) and Technology Acceptance Model ({TAM}). However, none of them considering customers' knowledge about riba that might become ethical aspect detaining them to use e-money as the mode of payment. The objective of this research is to examine the moderating effect of knowledge about riba on Technology Acceptance Model ({TAM}) variabels, such as perceived usefuleness, perceived ease of use and intention to use e-money. Data of this research are collected by distributing online questionnaires. By convenience sampling method, there are total 253 respondents. From the statistical computation, it is found that intention to use e-money is significantly affected by respondents' perception of e-money usefulness and ease of use. Interestingly, it is also found that customers' intention to use e-money are moderated by their knowledge about riba. Therefore, as managerial implication, it is suggested for e-money providers to build a Muslim-friendly system that is free from riba. Finally, this research also suggests future research agenda to consider subjective norm and religiosity variabels in a single model.},

In addition, this study examines the moderating role of knowledge in these relationships. Design/methodology/approach The researchers collected data via online surveys to reach the target population of this study, 55 years and older adults who had used mobile devices for tourism. The researchers used the partial least squares approach for this study. Findings The results reveal that ease of use has significant effects on extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. The motivations of usefulness and enjoyment significantly affect attachment, which, in turn, influences usage intention. The relationships between ease of use and usefulness, ease of use and enjoyment and enjoyment and attachment were stronger for the high-knowledge group than for the low-knowledge group. The relationship between usefulness and attachment was stronger for the low-knowledge group than for the high-knowledge group. Research limitations/implications The findings of this study provide compelling implications for academics and practitioners in the senior tourism field. Originality/value The compelling insight of this study is the development of a research model that combines an emergent construct of attachment as a mediator and knowledge of technology as a moderator.},

	abstract = {The literature illustrates that technology will widen health disparity if its use is restricted to patients who are already motivated and demonstrate good self-management behaviours. Additionally, despite the availability of free mobile health (m-health) applications for diabetes self-management, usage is low. There are also limited studies of m-health acceptance in South Africa. This research is delineated to the Western Cape, South Africa. The populace suffers from increasing numbers of diabetic patients. Segments of the population also suffer from technological forms of exclusion, such as limited internet access. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify challenges for user acceptance that discourages the use of m-health applications. This study analysed 130 semi-structured interviews, using thematic content analysis. Respondents were predominantly female with type 2 diabetes, older than 50, residing in the Western Cape. It used key constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology ({UTAUT}) model. The results confirmed that all four {UTAUT} constructs; performance expectancy (“the degree to which an individual believes that using the system will help him or her to attain gains in performance”), effort expectancy (“the degree of ease associated with the use of the system”, social influence (“the degree to which an individual perceives that important others believe he or she should use the new system”) and facilitating conditions (“the degree to which an individual believes that an organisational and technical infrastructure exists to support the use of the system”), explains the challenges for m-health acceptance in low socio-economic areas. Factors such as technology anxiety, resistance to change and a lack of trust in the use of devices for self-management need to be considered when implementing future interventions.},

	abstract = {Background. Digital technologies increasingly shape today’s world of work. This not only affects sectors such as knowledge work and the automotive industry, but also the care sector. On the one hand, many nurses today use technologies supporting some selected and rather peripheral nursing tasks (e.g., electronic documentation). However, on the other hand, more comprehensive and additionally proximal care-related task devices (e.g., diagnostics via telecare) seem to be used less often. From a psychological perspective, attitudes towards technology are an important antecedent of user behaviour. Therefore, in two studies we aimed to examine if nurses’ attitudes towards four digital technology fields (i.e., electronic documentation {ED}, ambient assisted living {AAL}, telecare application and robotics) are differing in relation to the type of task substitution, how technology appraisal and knowledge shape these attitudes, and how attitudes predict user behaviour. Method. We conducted two cross-sectional survey studies with German nurses (Study 1: N = 148, Study 2: N = 252) with well-established scales (i.e., general and work-related positive and negative attitudes towards technologies, ease of use, usability, knowledge, and technology use). Results. We found that it is important to consider positive and negative attitudes towards technology distinctively as intercorrelations were only moderately negative. As expected, we found in both studies that nurses reported stronger positive and less negative attitudes towards technologies assumed to be substituting more specific and peripheral (e.g., {ED}) than comprehensive and proximal care tasks (e.g., robotics). Moreover, we found that two types of technology appraisal (ease of use and usability) both positively correlated with positive attitudes towards all four technology fields, whereas patterns were more inconsistent and additionally influenced by technology knowledge when predicting negative attitudes. Although inconsistently across both studies and the considered technologies, in general, technology users reported more positive and less negative attitudes than non-users. Conclusion. If technology developers and nursing facility managers want to help nurses successfully adopting new technologies in their work routines, nurses’ technology appraisal and technology attitudes have to be considered already in the pre-development phase. Our study results show that nurses report different attitudes towards the four digital technology fields considered here in relation to the levels and types of task-substitution. More specifically, if core carerelated work-tasks (e.g., direct care) are not substituted, nurses report stronger positive and less negative attitudes towards the supporting technologies and higher user behaviour.},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

Furthermore, with thousands of studies using these theories, their contribution to knowledge has reached a plateau. In this commentary, we discuss some of the criticism of {TAM} and {UTAUT}, and argue that biomedical informatics research would benefit from shifting attention from these theories to multi-dimensional approaches that can better capture the complexity of issues surrounding implementation and use of {HIT}.

	abstract = {Background: Many promising technological innovations in health and social care are characterized by nonadoption or abandonment by individuals or by failed attempts to scale up locally, spread distantly, or sustain the innovation long term at the organization or system level. Objective: Our objective was to produce an evidence-based, theory-informed, and pragmatic framework to help predict and evaluate the success of a technology-supported health or social care program. Methods: The study had 2 parallel components: (1) secondary research (hermeneutic systematic review) to identify key domains, and (2) empirical case studies of technology implementation to explore, test, and refine these domains. We studied 6 technology-supported programs—video outpatient consultations, global positioning system tracking for cognitive impairment, pendant alarm services, remote biomarker monitoring for heart failure, care organizing software, and integrated case management via data sharing—using longitudinal ethnography and action research for up to 3 years across more than 20 organizations. Data were collected at micro level (individual technology users), meso level (organizational processes and systems), and macro level (national policy and wider context). Analysis and synthesis was aided by sociotechnically informed theories of individual, organizational, and system change. The draft framework was shared with colleagues who were introducing or evaluating other technology-supported health or care programs and refined in response to feedback. Results: The literature review identified 28 previous technology implementation frameworks, of which 14 had taken a dynamic systems approach (including 2 integrative reviews of previous work). Our empirical dataset consisted of over 400 hours of ethnographic observation, 165 semistructured interviews, and 200 documents. The final nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability ({NASSS}) framework included questions in 7 domains: the condition or illness, the technology, the value proposition, the adopter system (comprising professional staff, patient, and lay caregivers), the organization(s), the wider (institutional and societal) context, and the interaction and mutual adaptation between all these domains over time. Our empirical case studies raised a variety of challenges across all 7 domains, each classified as simple (straightforward, predictable, few components), complicated (multiple interacting components or issues), or complex (dynamic, unpredictable, not easily disaggregated into constituent components). Programs characterized by complicatedness proved difficult but not impossible to implement. Those characterized by complexity in multiple {NASSS} domains rarely, if ever, became mainstreamed. The framework showed promise when applied (both prospectively and retrospectively) to other programs. Conclusions: Subject to further empirical testing, {NASSS} could be applied across a range of technological innovations in health and social care. It has several potential uses: (1) to inform the design of a new technology; (2) to identify technological solutions that (perhaps despite policy or industry enthusiasm) have a limited chance of achieving large-scale, sustained adoption; (3) to plan the implementation, scale-up, or rollout of a technology program; and (4) to explain and learn from program failures.},

	abstract = {Background: Significant investments and advances in health care technologies and practices have created a need for digital and data-literate health care providers. Artificial intelligence ({AI}) algorithms transform the analysis, diagnosis, and treatment of medical conditions. Complex and massive data sets are informing significant health care decisions and clinical practices. The ability to read, manage, and interpret large data sets to provide data-driven care and to protect patient privacy are increasingly critical skills for today’s health care providers.
Objective: The aim of this study is to accelerate the appropriate adoption of data-driven and {AI}-enhanced care by focusing on the mindsets, skillsets, and toolsets of point-of-care health providers and their leaders in the health system.
Methods: To accelerate the adoption of {AI} and the need for organizational change at a national level, our multistepped approach includes creating awareness and capacity building, learning through innovation and adoption, developing appropriate and strategic partnerships, and building effective knowledge exchange initiatives. Education interventions designed to adapt knowledge to the local context and address any challenges to knowledge use include engagement activities to increase awareness, educational curricula for health care providers and leaders, and the development of a coaching and practice-based innovation hub. Framed by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, we are currently in the knowledge creation stage to inform the curricula for each deliverable. An environmental scan and scoping review were conducted to understand the current state of {AI} education programs as reported in the academic literature.
Results: The environmental scan identified 24 {AI}-accredited programs specific to health providers, of which 11 were from the United States, 6 from Canada, 4 from the United Kingdom, and 3 from Asian countries. The most common curriculum topics across the environmental scan and scoping review included {AI} fundamentals, applications of {AI}, applied machine learning in health care, ethics, data science, and challenges to and opportunities for using {AI}.
Conclusions: Technologies are advancing more rapidly than organizations, and professionals can adopt and adapt to them. To help shape {AI} practices, health care providers must have the skills and abilities to initiate change and shape the future of their discipline and practices for advancing high-quality care within the digital ecosystem.

Background
In 2000, four community hospitals in the Cleveland Clinic Health System embarked on an electronic medical record ({EMR}) project to create an integrated information management environment and improve clinical decision making.
Methods
Executives and individuals from many departments and disciplines were organized into a project structure to launch the project, make decisions, and accomplish change management, which addressed communication, work-flow redesign, training, and support during transition to the new technology-enabled process.
Project
In 1999, a small group of regional information technology ({IT}) leaders for four community hospitals operated by the Cleveland Clinic Health System in the East Region developed a project for the implementation of computerized physician order management ({CPOM}).
Results
Huron Hospital, the first hospital selected for implementation, met its goals for a successful transition. After two pilots, implementation occurred on schedule and with a noticeable lack of major issues, both during rollout and thereafter. In addition, physician direct entry of orders reached the first-year goal of 40\% physician entry in the first month and 75\% within a year.
Conclusions
Ensuring success required a systematic approach to the foundations of change management—work-flow redesign, communication, training, and support—during the transition.},

The errors do not affect the results or conclusions of the study as the final number of meta-analysable studies are the same as originally reported.] A meta-analysis examining temporal changes (time trends) in the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy ({CBT}) as a treatment for unipolar depression was conducted. A comprehensive search of psychotherapy trials yielded 70 eligible studies from 1977 to 2014. Effect sizes ({ES}) were quantified as Hedge’s g based on the Beck Depression Inventory ({BDI}) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ({HRSD}). Rates of remission were also registered. The publication year of each study was examined as a linear metaregression predictor of {ES}, and as part of a 2-way interaction with other moderators (Year × Moderator). The average {ES} of the {BDI} was 1.58 (95\% {CI} [1.43, 1.74]), and 1.69 for the {HRSD} (95\% {CI} [1.48, 1.89]). Subgroup analyses revealed that women profited more from therapy than did men (p {\textless} .05). Experienced psychologists (g = 1.55) achieved better results (p {\textless} .01) than less experienced student therapists (g = 0.98). The metaregressions examining the temporal trends indicated that the effects of {CBT} have declined linearly and steadily since its introduction, as measured by patients’ self-reports (the {BDI}, p {\textless} .001), clinicians’ ratings (the {HRSD}, p {\textless} .01) and rates of remission (p {\textless} .01). Subgroup analyses confirmed that the declining trend was present in both within-group (pre/post) designs (p {\textless} .01) and controlled trial designs (p = .02). Thus, modern {CBT} clinical trials seemingly provided less relief from depressive symptoms as compared with the seminal trials. Potential causes and possible implications for future studies are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Previous research indicates that motivational interviewing ({MI}) skills decline over time among participants in training workshops when post-workshop feedback and coaching are not provided. This study explored moderators of skill retention among trainees learning {MI} mainly for substance use disorder treatment in real-world treatment settings, including workshop enhancements and type and dose of post-workshop feedback and coaching. Methods A meta-analysis of training studies was conducted with studies that reported {MI} skills using observational measures and that included trainees from real-world agency settings. Standardized change scores were calculated to indicate the magnitude of pre–post training change in {MI} skills; standardized change scores from post-training to 3 and 6+ months follow-up were calculated to indicate the sustainability of training gains over time. Effect sizes were aggregated using random effects models. Results Twenty-one papers that reported the effects of {MI} training on agency staff were included in this review. Across studies, training yielded gains in {MI} skills (d = 0.76). Studies that did not include feedback and/or coaching reported eroding skills over a 6-month follow-up (d = −0.30), whereas post-workshop feedback/coaching sustained skills (d = 0.03). Effects of post-workshop feedback/coaching were moderated by frequency, duration and length of training. Moreover, studies reporting low levels of attrition from training protocols showed small increases in skills over the 6-month follow-up period (d = 0.12), whereas studies with high attrition showed skill erosion (d = −0.29). Conclusions On average, three to four feedback/coaching sessions over a 6-month period sustain skills among trainees for motivational interviewing, mainly for substance use disorder treatment. However, high rates of attrition from feedback/coaching contributes to post-workshop skill erosion.},

	abstract = {Background: Training therapists is both expensive and time-consuming. Degree–based training can require tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of expert instruction. Counseling skills practice often involves role-plays, standardized patients, or practice with real clients. Performance–based feedback is critical for skill development and expertise, but trainee therapists often receive minimal and subjective feedback, which is distal to their skill practice. Objective: In this study, we developed and evaluated a patient-like neural conversational agent, which provides real-time feedback to trainees via chat–based interaction. Methods: The text–based conversational agent was trained on an archive of 2354 psychotherapy transcripts and provided specific feedback on the use of basic interviewing and counseling skills (ie, open questions and reflections—summary statements of what a client has said). A total of 151 nontherapists were randomized to either (1) immediate feedback on their use of open questions and reflections during practice session with {ClientBot} or (2) initial education and encouragement on the skills. Results: Participants in the {ClientBot} condition used 91\% (21.4/11.2) more reflections during practice with feedback (P{\textless}.001) and 76\% (14.1/8) more reflections after feedback was removed (P{\textless}.001) relative to the control group. The treatment group used more open questions during training but not after feedback was removed, suggesting that certain skills may not improve with performance–based feedback. Finally, after feedback was removed, the {ClientBot} group used 31\% (32.5/24.7) more listening skills overall (P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that practice and feedback can improve trainee use of basic counseling skills.},

	abstract = {Direct observation of psychotherapy and providing performance-based feedback is the gold-standard approach for training psychotherapists. At present, this requires experts and training human coding teams, which is slow, expensive, and labor intensive. Machine learning and speech signal processing technologies provide a way to scale up feedback in psychotherapy. We evaluated an initial proof of concept automated feedback system that generates motivational interviewing quality metrics and provides easy access to other session data (e.g., transcripts). The system automatically provides a report of session-level metrics (e.g., therapist empathy) and therapist behavior codes at the talk-turn level (e.g., reflections). We assessed usability, therapist satisfaction, perceived accuracy, and intentions to adopt. A sample of 21 novice (n = 10) or experienced (n = 11) therapists each completed a 10-min session with a standardized patient. The system received the audio from the session as input and then automatically generated feedback that therapists accessed via a web portal. All participants found the system easy to use and were satisfied with their feedback, 83\% found the feedback consistent with their own perceptions of their clinical performance, and 90\% reported they were likely to use the feedback in their practice. We discuss the implications of applying new technologies to evaluation of psychotherapy. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2019 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology ({UTAUT}) is a little over a decade old and has been used extensively in information systems ({IS}) and other fields, as the large number of citations to the original paper that introduced the theory evidences. In this paper, we review and synthesize the {IS} literature on {UTAUT} from September 2003 until December 2014, perform a theoretical analysis of {UTAUT} and its extensions, and chart an agenda for research going forward. Based on Weber’s (2012) framework of theory evaluation, we examined {UTAUT} and its extensions along two sets of quality dimensions; namely, the parts of a theory and the theory as a whole. While our review identifies many merits to {UTAUT}, we also found that the progress related to this theory has hampered further theoretical development in research into technology acceptance and use. To chart an agenda for research that will enable significant future work, we analyze the theoretical contributions of {UTAUT} using Whetten’s (2009) notion of cross-context theorizing. Our analysis reveals several limitations that lead us to propose a multi-level framework that can serve as the theoretical foundation for future research. Specifically, this framework integrates the notion of research context and cross-context theorizing with the theory evaluation framework to: (1) synthesize the existing {UTAUT} extensions across both the dimensions and the levels of the research context and (2) highlight promising research directions. We conclude with recommendations for future {UTAUT}-related research using the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Information technology ({IT}) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of {PC} utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology ({UTAUT}), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. {UTAUT} was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). {UTAUT} was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). {UTAUT} thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in {UTAUT}, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},

	abstract = {Background Students with complex health care services process face constant challenges with regard to health education. The mobile devices are an important tool that can install various applications for using information such as clinical guidelines, drug resources, clinical calculations, and the latest scientiﬁc evidence without any time and place limitations. And this happens only when students accept and use it.
Objective The purpose of this article is to identify the factors inﬂuencing students in their intention to use mobile health ({mHealth}) by using Uniﬁed Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology ({UTAUT}) model.
Methods A standard questionnaire was used to collect the data from nearly 302 Lorestan University of medical science students including nutrition and public health, paramedicine, nursing and midwifery, pharmacy, dentistry, and medical schools. The data were processed using {LISREL} (Scientiﬁc Software International, Inc., Lincolnwood, Illinois) and {SPSS} ({IBM} Corp., Armonk, New York) softwares and the statistical analysis technique was based on structural equation modeling ({SEM}).
Result A total of 300 questionnaires including valid responses were used in this study. The results showed that mediator of age did not affect the predictors of intention to use {mHealth}, and the level of education and gender directly affected the intention to use. In addition, effort expectancy, facilitating condition, and behavioral intention directly and indirectly have effect on use, whereas the result revealed no signiﬁcant relationship between two important processes of performance expectancy and social inﬂuence with students’ behavioral intention to use the {mHealth}.
Conclusions The present study provides valuable information on mobile health acceptance factors for widespread use of this device among students of universities of medical sciences as a base infrastructure for a variety of information about health services and learning. Review and comparison of results with other studies showed that {mHealth} acceptance factors were different from other end users (elderly, patients, and health professionals).},

Yet psychiatrists and investigators now have an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from complex patterns in brain, behavior, and genes using methods from machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, modern neural-network algorithms, cross-validation procedures). Combining these analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than {DSM}/{ICD} diagnoses can. In a new era of evidence-based psychiatry tailored to single patients, objectively measurable endophenotypes could allow for early disease detection, individualized treatment selection, and dosage adjustment to reduce the burden of disease.

We will then discuss and review directions along which (deep) neural networks can be, or already have been, applied in the context of psychiatry, and will try to delineate their future potential in this area. We will also comment on an emerging area that so far has been much less well explored: by embedding semantically interpretable computational models of brain dynamics or behavior into a statistical machine learning context, insights into dysfunction beyond mere prediction and classification may be gained. Especially this marriage of computational models with statistical inference may offer insights into neural and behavioral mechanisms that could open completely novel avenues for psychiatric treatment.},

	abstract = {For many years, psychiatrists have tried to understand factors involved in response to medications or psychotherapies, in order to personalize their treatment choices. There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real-world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to-date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of mental health care, and several prospective clinical studies suggest that it may be working already.},

The data set of proposed research model is collected through paper survey and Internet survey in China. The empirical examination demonstrates a high predictive power of this proposed model in explaining {AIMDSS} adoption. Finally, the theoretical contribution and practical implications of this research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: An artificial intelligence ({AI})–assisted contouring system benefits radiation oncologists by saving time and improving treatment accuracy. Yet, there is much hope and fear surrounding such technologies, and this fear can manifest as resistance from health care professionals, which can lead to the failure of {AI} projects.
Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and test a model for investigating the factors that drive radiation oncologists’ acceptance of {AI} contouring technology in a Chinese context.
Methods: A model of {AI}-assisted contouring technology acceptance was developed based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology ({UTAUT}) model by adding the variables of perceived risk and resistance that were proposed in this study. The model included 8 constructs with 29 questionnaire items. A total of 307 respondents completed the questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was conducted to evaluate the model’s path effects, significance, and fitness.
Results: The overall fitness indices for the model were evaluated and showed that the model was a good fit to the data. Behavioral intention was significantly affected by performance expectancy (β=.155; P=.01), social influence (β=.365; P\&lt;.001), and facilitating conditions (β=.459; P\&lt;.001). Effort expectancy (β=.055; P=.45), perceived risk (β=−.048; P=.35), and resistance bias (β=−.020; P=.63) did not significantly affect behavioral intention.
Conclusions: The physicians’ overall perceptions of an {AI}-assisted technology for radiation contouring were high. Technology resistance among Chinese radiation oncologists was low and not related to behavioral intention. Not all of the factors in the Venkatesh {UTAUT} model applied to {AI} technology adoption among physicians in a Chinese context.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of artificial intelligence ({AI}) in the medical industry promises many benefits, so {AI} has been introduced to medical practice primarily in developed countries. In Japan, the government is preparing for the rollout of {AI} in the medical industry. This rollout depends on doctors and the public accepting the technology. Therefore it is necessary to consider acceptance among doctors and among the public. However, little is known about the acceptance of {AI} in medicine in Japan.
Objective: This study aimed to obtain detailed data on the acceptance of {AI} in medicine by comparing the acceptance among Japanese doctors with that among the Japanese public.
Methods: We conducted an online survey, and the responses of doctors and members of the public were compared. {AI} in medicine was defined as the use of {AI} to determine diagnosis and treatment without requiring a doctor. A questionnaire was prepared referred to as the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, a model of behavior toward new technologies. It comprises 20 items, and each item was rated on a five-point scale. Using this questionnaire, we conducted an online survey in 2018 among 399 doctors and 600 members of the public. The sample-wide responses were analyzed, and then the responses of the doctors were compared with those of the public using t tests.
Results: Regarding the sample-wide responses (N=999), 653 (65.4\%) of the respondents believed, in the future, {AI} in medicine would be necessary, whereas only 447 (44.7\%) expressed an intention to use {AI}-driven medicine. Additionally, 730 (73.1\%) believed that regulatory legislation was necessary, and 734 (73.5\%) were concerned about where accountability lies. Regarding the comparison between doctors and the public, doctors (mean 3.43, {SD} 1.00) were more likely than members of the public (mean 3.23, {SD} 0.92) to express intention to use {AI}-driven medicine (P\&lt;.001), suggesting that optimism about {AI} in medicine is greater among doctors compared to the public.
Conclusions: Many of the respondents were optimistic about the role of {AI} in medicine. However, when asked whether they would like to use {AI}-driven medicine, they tended to give a negative response. This trend suggests that concerns about the lack of regulation and about accountability hindered acceptance. Additionally, the results revealed that doctors were more enthusiastic than members of the public regarding {AI}-driven medicine. For the successful implementation of {AI} in medicine, it would be necessary to inform the public and doctors about the relevant laws and to take measures to remove their concerns about them.},

Particularly, complex structural equation models with relatively small sample sizes were the study focus. Through a simulation study and an empirical example, results indicated that the enet outperformed other methods in small samples for identifying biased items.

The technological data analysis and predictions made by Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) technologies have assisted medical staff in designing personalized medicine for patients, making {AI} technologies an important path to precision medicine. During the implementation of the new emerging technology, medical staff’s learning intentions will have a great influence on its effectiveness. With reference to the Technology Acceptance Model, this study explored medical staff’s attitudes, intentions, and relevant influencing factors in relation to {AI} application learning. A total of 285 valid questionnaires were collected. Five major factors, perceived usefulness ({PU}), perceived ease of use ({PEU}), subjective norms ({SN}), attitude towards {AI} use ({ATU}), and behavioral intention ({BI}), were used for analyzing the {AI} learning of medical staff in a hospital. Based on the {SEM} analytical results and the research model, the four endogenous constructs of {PU}, {PEU}, {SN}, and {ATU} explained 37.4\% of the changes in {BI}. In this model, {SN} and {PEU} were the determining factors of {BI}. The total effects of {SN} and {PEU} were 0.448 and 0.408 respectively, followed by {PU}, with a total effect of 0.244. As a result, the intentions of medical staff to learn to use {AI} applications to support precision medicine can be predicted by {SN}, {PEU}, {PU}, and {ATU}. Among them, subjective norms considering the influences of both supervisors and peers, such as encouragement, communication, and sharing, may assist precision education in supporting the learning attitudes and behavior regarding precision medicine. The research results can provide recommendations for examining medical staff’s intention to use {AI} applications.]},

Self-assessed skill ratings significantly improved after the course, and the appreciation of the course content was very positive. However, we observed a substantial drop-out rate, mostly attributed to the lack of time of medical professionals. There is a high demand for educational offerings regarding {AI} in medical imaging among medical professionals, and better education may lead to a more realistic appreciation of clinical adoption.

The paper deals with the underlying research concepts related to personalized pre-treatment recommendations for drop-out risk and optimal treatment strategy selection as well as personalized adaptive recommendations during treatment. The development sample consisted of 1234 patients treated with cognitive behavioral therapy ({CBT}). Modern statistical machine learning techniques were used to develop personalized recommendations. Drop-out analyses resulted in seven significant predictors explaining 12.0\% of variance. The prediction of optimal treatment strategies resulted in differential prediction models substantially improving effect sizes and reliable improvement rates. The dynamic failure boundary reliably identified patients with a higher risk for no improvement or deterioration and indicated the usage of clinical problem-solving tools in risk areas. The probability to be reliably improved for patients identified as at risk for treatment failure was about half of the probability for other patients (35\% vs. 62.15\%; χ²df = 1 = 82.77, p {\textless} .001). Results related to the computer-based feedback system are discussed with regard to the implication for clinical applications as well as clinical training and future research possibilities.

In particular, {CHAT} provides researchers a theoretical lens to account for context and activity mediation and, by doing so, can increase the significance of information behavior research to practice. In undertaking this endeavour, we have relied on literature from the fields of information science and others where {CHAT} is employed.

	abstract = {The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory ({AST}) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. {AST} examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of {AST}, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system ({GDSS}). A {GDSS} is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the {GDSS} is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied.

We begin by positioning {AST} among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to {GDSS} use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of {AST}. We outline an analytic strategy for applying {AST} principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of {AST} is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization relationships. We can attain a better understanding of how to implement technologies, and we may also be able to develop improved designs or educational programs that promote productive adaptations.},

	shorttitle = {An evaluation framework for Health Information Systems},
	abstract = {Background and purpose
The realization of Health Information Systems ({HIS}) requires rigorous evaluation that addresses technology, human and organization issues. Our review indicates that current evaluation methods evaluate different aspects of {HIS} and they can be improved upon. A new evaluation framework, human, organization and technology-fit ({HOT}-fit) was developed after having conducted a critical appraisal of the findings of existing {HIS} evaluation studies. {HOT}-fit builds on previous models of {IS} evaluation—in particular, the {IS} Success Model and the {IT}-Organization Fit Model. This paper introduces the new framework for {HIS} evaluation that incorporates comprehensive dimensions and measures of {HIS} and provides a technological, human and organizational fit.
Methods
Literature review on {HIS} and {IS} evaluation studies and pilot testing of developed framework. The framework was used to evaluate a Fundus Imaging System ({FIS}) of a primary care organization in the {UK}. The case study was conducted through observation, interview and document analysis.
Results
The main findings show that having the right user attitude and skills base together with good leadership, {IT}-friendly environment and good communication can have positive influence on the system adoption.
Conclusions
Comprehensive, specific evaluation factors, dimensions and measures in the new framework ({HOT}-fit) are applicable in {HIS} evaluation. The use of such a framework is argued to be useful not only for comprehensive evaluation of the particular {FIS} system under investigation, but potentially also for any Health Information System in general.},

There is increasing interest, but little substantive theory, in the role the variables in these data play in known processes.This necessitates exploratory mediation analysis, for which structural equation modeling is the benchmark method. However, this method cannot perform mediation analysis with more variables than observations. One option is to run a series of univariate mediation models, which incorrectly assumes independence of the mediators. Another option is regularization, but the available implementations may lead to high false-positive rates.In this article, we develop a hybrid approach which uses components of both filter and regularization: the ‘Coordinate-wise Mediation Filter’. It performs filtering conditional on the other selected mediators. We show through simulation that it improves performance over existing methods. Finally, we provide an empirical example, showing how our method may be used for epigenetic research.},

The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of “close fit” of a model is suggested.},

Using latent moderated structural equation modeling, I test the model on a sample of 204 {IBTs} collected at two time points. Results show that, through the psychological state of thriving at work, travel frequency has a negative indirect association with {IBTs}' global role turnover intentions when {IBTs}' work roles are challenging and a positive association when their work lacks challenge. This is primarily the case regarding the challenge of being responsible for others at work. The novelty of {IBTs}' work tasks is also a salient challenge but to a lesser extent.

The purpose of this paper is to enhance the understanding of Generation Y and to present new insights regarding Gen Y's retail career expectations, perceptions of retail careers, future psychological contract/entitlement perceptions of retail careers, and career exploration of the {US} retailing industry. Design/methodology/approach – Utilizing quantitative research methods via an on‐line survey, the authors examined 193 Gen Y college seniors' retail career perceptions and expectations, and explored the influence these factors have on future psychological contract/entitlement perceptions of employer‐employee obligations and retail career exploration from nine {US} universities. Findings – College seniors' pre‐entry retail job expectations, perceptions of retail careers, and future psychological contract/entitlement perceptions of employee obligations were significant predictors of career exploration; college seniors' preconceived notions of retail careers, combined with what they feel they would owe their future employer, are instrumental in determining retail career exploration decisions. Research limitations/implications – Findings suggest directions for university faculty, academic advisors, and industry practitioners on facilitating college seniors' transitions from higher education to the world of work by suggesting recruitment strategies that can attract, retain and motivate Gen Y. Originality/value – The findings provide useful criteria for organizational development strategies to assist with the transition from higher education to the workforce and may also improve the success of recruiting Gen Y employees.

Further, the functionality of these identity processes, and especially of exploration, changed over time. Exploration in breadth and exploration in depth were strongly related to commitment processes especially in adolescence and emerging adulthood, but these exploration processes became increasingly associated with ruminative exploration and depressive symptoms in the late 20s. Theoretical implications and suggestions for future research are outlined.},

However, {TAM} and {UTAUT} have also been criticized for being overly simplistic ({TAM}) and for taking a narrow perspective, which focuses only on individual adopters’ beliefs, perceptions and usage intention. Furthermore, with thousands of studies using these theories, their contribution to knowledge has reached a plateau. In this commentary, we discuss some of the criticism of {TAM} and {UTAUT}, and argue that biomedical informatics research would benefit from shifting attention from these theories to multi-dimensional approaches that can better capture the complexity of issues surrounding implementation and use of {HIT}. We propose a number of future undertakings which, in our opinion, are more likely to move the field forward.},

As this tool gives us interpretable measures of therapy content, it can enable services to quality control the therapy delivered.

	abstract = {Depression is a leading cause of disease burden worldwide,
however there is an unmet need for screening and diagnostic
measures that can be widely deployed in real-world
environments. Voice-based diagnostic methods are convenient,
non-invasive to elicit, and can be collected and processed in
near real-time using modern smartphones, smart speakers, and
other devices. Studies in voice-based depression detection to
date have primarily focused on laboratory-collected voice
samples, which are not representative of typical user
environments or devices. This paper conducts the first
investigation of voice-based depression assessment techniques
on real-world data from 887 speakers, recorded using a variety
of different smartphones. Evaluations on 16 hours of speech
show that conservative segment selection strategies using
highly thresholded voice activity detection, coupled with
tailored normalization approaches are effective for mitigating
smartphone channel variability and background environmental
noise. Together, these strategies can achieve F1 scores
comparable with or better than those from a combination of
clean recordings, a single recording environment and long
utterances. The scalability of speech elicitation via smartphone
allows detailed models dependent on gender, smartphone
manufacturer and/or elicitation task. Interestingly, results
herein suggest that normalization based on these criteria may
be more effective than tailored models for detecting depressed
speech.},

	abstract = {Objective
To determine the efficacy of psychotherapy interventions for reducing suicidal attempts ({SA}) and non-suicidal self-injury ({NSSI}).
Methods
Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) comparing psychotherapy interventions and treatment as usual ({TAU}; including also enhanced usual care, psychotropic treatment alone, cognitive remediation, short-term problem-oriented approach, supportive relationship treatment, community treatment by non-behavioral psychotherapy experts, emergency care enhanced by provider education, no treatment) for {SA}/{NSSI}. {RCTs} were extracted from {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, {PsycINFO} and Cochrane Library and analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager Software and Comprehensive Meta-analysis.
Results
In the 32 included {RCTs}, 4114 patients were randomly assigned to receive psychotherapy (n = 2106) or {TAU} (n = 2008). Patients who received psychotherapy were less likely to attempt suicide during the follow-up. The pooled risk difference for {SA} was −0.08 (95\% confidence intervals = −0.04 to −0.11). The absolute risk reduction was 6.59\% (psychotherapy: 9.12\%; {TAU}: 15.71\%), yielding an estimated number needed to treat of 15. Sensitivity analyses showed that psychotherapy was effective for {SA} mainly in adults, outpatients, patients with borderline personality disorder, previously and non-previously suicidal patients (heterogeneous variable that included past history of {SA}, {NSSI}, deliberate self-harm, imminent suicidal risk or suicidal ideation), long- and short-term therapies, {TAU} only as a control condition, and mentalization-based treatment ({MBT}). No evidence of efficacy was found for {NSSI}, with the exception of {MBT}. Between-study heterogeneity and publication bias were detected. In the presence of publication bias, the Duval and Tweedie's “trim and fill” method was applied.
Conclusion
Psychotherapy seems to be effective for {SA} treatment. However, trials with lower risk of bias, more homogeneous outcome measures and longer follow-up are needed.},

Machines and robots equipped with cognitive capability can automatically recognize a humans mental state through their gestures and facial expressions. In this paper, an artificial intelligent system is proposed to monitor depression. It can predict the scales of Beck depression inventory {II} ({BDI}-{II}) from vocal and visual expressions. First, different visual features are extracted from facial expression images. Deep learning method is utilized to extract key visual features from the facial expression frames. Second, spectral low-level descriptors and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients features are extracted from short audio segments to capture the vocal expressions. Third, feature dynamic history histogram ({FDHH}) is proposed to capture the temporal movement on the feature space. Finally, these {FDHH} and audio features are fused using regression techniques for the prediction of the {BDI}-{II} scales. The proposed method has been tested on the public Audio/Visual Emotion Challenges 2014 dataset as it is tuned to be more focused on the study of depression. The results outperform all the other existing methods on the same dataset.},

To test the expanded {IS} continuance model, we conducted a longitudinal field study of 3159 Hong Kong citizens across two electronic government (e-government) technologies that enable citizens' access to government services. In general, the results support the expanded model that provides a rich understanding of the changes in the pre-usage beliefs and attitudes through the emergent constructs of disconfirmation and satisfaction, ultimately influencing {IS} continuance intention.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) is currently changing how people live and work. Its importance has prompted educators to begin teaching {AI} in secondary schools. This study examined how Chinese secondary school students’ intention to learn {AI} were associated with eight other relevant psychological factors. Five hundred and forty-five secondary school students who have completed at least one cycle of {AI} course were recruited to participate in this study. Based on the theory of planned behavior, the students’ {AI} literacy, subjective norms, and anxiety were identified as background factors. These background factors were hypothesized to influence the students’ attitudes towards {AI}, their perceived behavioral control, and their intention to learn {AI}. To provide more nuanced understanding, the students’ attitude towards {AI} was further delineated as constituted by their perception of the usefulness of {AI}, the potential of {AI} technology to promote social good, and their attitude towards using {AI} technology. Similarly, the perceived behavioral control was operationalized as students’ confidence towards learning {AI} knowledge and optimistic outlook of an {AI} infused world. Relationships between the factors were theoretically illustrated as a model that depicts how students’ intention to learn {AI} was constituted. Two research questions were then formulated. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to validate that multi-factor survey, followed by structural equational modelling to ascertain the significant associations between the factors. The confirmatory factor analysis supports the construct validity of the questionnaire. Twenty-five out of the thirty-three hypotheses were supported through structural equation modelling. The model helps researchers and educators to understand the factors that shape students’ intention to learn {AI}. These factors should be considered for the design of {AI} curriculum.},

This dichotomy leads to mixed feelings toward {AI}: people recognize the positive impact of {AI}, but they also show concerns, especially about their privacy and security. In this article, we try to understand whether the implicit and explicit attitudes toward {AI} are coherent. We investigated explicit and implicit attitudes toward {AI} by combining a self-report measure and an implicit measure, i.e., the implicit association test. We analyzed the explicit and implicit responses of 829 participants. Results revealed that while most of the participants explicitly express a positive attitude toward {AI}, their implicit responses seem to point in the opposite direction. Results also show that, in both the explicit and implicit measures, females show a more negative attitude than males, and people who work in the field of {AI} are inclined to be positive toward {AI}.},

	abstract = {People vary in the extent to which they report fear toward robots, especially when they perceive that the robot is autonomous or has artificial intelligence. This research examines a specific form of sociological fear, which we name as fear of autonomous robots and artificial intelligence ({FARAI}). This fear may serve to affect how people will respond to and interact with robots. Applying data from a nationally representative dataset with probability sampling (N = 1541), research questions examine (1) the extent and frequency of {FARAI}, (2) demographic and media exposure predictors, and (3) correlates with other types of fear (i.e., loneliness, drones, and unemployment). A latent class analysis reveals that approximately 26\% of participants reported experiencing a heightened level of {FARAI}. Demographic analyses show that {FARAI} is connected to participant sex, age, education, and household income; albeit these effects were small. Media exposure to science fiction predicts {FARAI} above and beyond the demographic variables. Correlational results indicate that {FARAI} is associated with other types of fear, including loneliness, becoming unemployed, and drone use. In sum, these findings render a much needed glimpse and update regarding how much individuals fear robots and artificial intelligence.},

	abstract = {In the context of (digital) human–machine interaction, people are increasingly dealing with artificial intelligence in everyday life. Through this, we observe humans who embrace technological advances with a positive attitude. Others, however, are particularly sceptical and claim to foresee substantial problems arising from such uses of technology. The aim of the present study was to introduce a short measure to assess the Attitude Towards Artificial Intelligence ({ATAI} scale) in the German, Chinese, and English languages. Participants from Germany (N = 461; 345 females), China (N = 413; 145 females), and the {UK} (N = 84; 65 females) completed the {ATAI} scale, for which the factorial structure was tested and compared between the samples. Participants from Germany and China were additionally asked about their willingness to interact with/use self-driving cars, Siri, Alexa, the social robot Pepper, and the humanoid robot Erica, which are representatives of popular artificial intelligence products. The results showed that the five-item {ATAI} scale comprises two negatively associated factors assessing (1) acceptance and (2) fear of artificial intelligence. The factor structure was found to be similar across the German, Chinese, and {UK} samples. Additionally, the {ATAI} scale was validated, as the items on the willingness to use specific artificial intelligence products were positively associated with the {ATAI} Acceptance scale and negatively with the {ATAI} Fear scale, in both the German and Chinese samples. In conclusion we introduce a short, reliable, and valid measure on the attitude towards artificial intelligence in German, Chinese, and English language.},

As in linear regression models, high correlations between predictors can lead to unstable parameter estimates (i.e., large standard errors) and reduced statistical power. Regularized estimation methods, which have recently become available for {SEMs}, may provide more stable estimates in the presence of multicollinearity at the cost of a certain amount of bias in the estimated parameters. In a simulation study, we compared the performance of nonregularized {SEM} with Ridge and Elastic net regularized {SEMs} in the presence of strong multicollinearity. The results provide evidence that Ridge and Elastic net regularized {SEMs} provide more stable estimates and greater statistical power than nonregularized {SEM}. However, the biases from regularized estimation can result in increased Type I error rates. This phenomenon was more pronounced in Ridge than in Elastic net regularized {SEMs}.

	abstract = {The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology ({UTAUT}) is a little over a decade old and has been used extensively in information systems ({IS}) and other fields, as the large number of citations to the original paper that introduced the theory evidences. In this paper, we review and synthesize the {IS} literature on {UTAUT} from September 2003 until December 2014, perform a theoretical analysis of {UTAUT} and its extensions, and chart an agenda for research going forward. Based on Weber’s (2012) framework of theory evaluation, we examined {UTAUT} and its extensions along two sets of quality dimensions; namely, the parts of a theory and the theory as a whole. While our review identifies many merits to {UTAUT}, we also found that the progress related to this theory has hampered further theoretical development in research into technology acceptance and use. To chart an agenda for research that will enable significant future work, we analyze the theoretical contributions of {UTAUT} using Whetten’s (2009) notion of cross-context theorizing. Our analysis reveals several limitations that lead us to propose a multi-level framework that can serve as the theoretical foundation for future research. Specifically, this framework integrates the notion of research context and cross-context theorizing with the theory evaluation framework to: (1) synthesize the existing {UTAUT} extensions across both the dimensions and the levels of the research context and (2) highlight promising research directions. We conclude with recommendations for future {UTAUT}-related research using the proposed framework.},

Objective: Using an extended {UTAUT} model to gain insight into the predictors of technology usage intentions for two specific {AI}-enabled mental healthcare tools.
Methods: A cross-sectional study included 206 psychology students and psychotherapists-in-training to examine the predictors of their intention to use two {AI}-enabled mental healthcare tools. The first tool provides feedback to the psychotherapist on their adherence to motivational interviewing techniques. The second tool uses patient voice samples to derive mood scores that the therapist may use for treatment decisions. Participants were presented with graphic depictions of the tools’ functioning mechanisms before measuring the variables of an extended {UTAUT}. Two structural equation models (one for each tool) were specified that included direct and mediated paths predicting tool usage intentions.
Results: Perceived usefulness and social influence had a positive effect on the intention to use both tools. However, trust was unrelated to usage intention for both tools. Moreover, perceived ease of use was unrelated (feedback tool) and even negatively related (treatment recommendation tool) to usage intentions when considering all predictors. In addition, a direct relationship between cognitive technology readiness and the intention to use the feedback tool, and a negative relationship between {AI} anxiety and usage intentions were observed.
Conclusions: The results shed light on general and tool-dependent drivers of {AI} technology adoption in mental healthcare. Future research may explore technological and user group characteristics that influence the adoption of {AI}-enabled tools in mental healthcare.},

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence ({AI}) necessitates promoting {AI} education at the K-12 level. However, educating young learners to become {AI} literate citizens poses several challenges. The components of {AI} literacy are ill-defined and it is unclear to what extent middle school students can engage in learning about {AI} as a sociotechnical system with socio-political implications. In this paper we posit that students must learn three core domains of {AI}: technical concepts and processes, ethical and societal implications, and career futures in the {AI} era. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Developing {AI} Literacy ({DAILy}) workshop that aimed to integrate middle school students’ learning of the three domains. We found that after the workshop, most students developed a general understanding of {AI} concepts and processes (e.g., supervised learning and logic systems). More importantly, they were able to identify bias, describe ways to mitigate bias in machine learning, and start to consider how {AI} may impact their future lives and careers. At exit, nearly half of the students explained {AI} as not just a technical subject, but one that has personal, career, and societal implications. Overall, this finding suggests that the approach of incorporating ethics and career futures into {AI} education is age appropriate and effective for developing {AI} literacy among middle school students. This study contributes to the field of {AI} Education by presenting a model of integrating ethics into the teaching of {AI} that is appropriate for middle school students.},

To evaluate the current state of the literature on {AI} literacy in higher and adult education, a scoping literature review was conducted with the objective of identifying thematic foci and recent research trends. Ten research databases were searched and out of 902 initial records, 30 studies were identified using predefined eligibility criteria, whereof the content was evaluated in the review. The results indicated that research in this area is still in its infancy and needs refinement in terms of how to define {AI} literacy in adult education as well as what content should be taught to non-experts.

	abstract = {Background: Significant investments and advances in health care technologies and practices have created a need for digital and data-literate health care providers. Artificial intelligence ({AI}) algorithms transform the analysis, diagnosis, and treatment of medical conditions. Complex and massive data sets are informing significant health care decisions and clinical practices. The ability to read, manage, and interpret large data sets to provide data-driven care and to protect patient privacy are increasingly critical skills for today’s health care providers.
Objective: The aim of this study is to accelerate the appropriate adoption of data-driven and {AI}-enhanced care by focusing on the mindsets, skillsets, and toolsets of point-of-care health providers and their leaders in the health system.
Methods: To accelerate the adoption of {AI} and the need for organizational change at a national level, our multistepped approach includes creating awareness and capacity building, learning through innovation and adoption, developing appropriate and strategic partnerships, and building effective knowledge exchange initiatives. Education interventions designed to adapt knowledge to the local context and address any challenges to knowledge use include engagement activities to increase awareness, educational curricula for health care providers and leaders, and the development of a coaching and practice-based innovation hub. Framed by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, we are currently in the knowledge creation stage to inform the curricula for each deliverable. An environmental scan and scoping review were conducted to understand the current state of {AI} education programs as reported in the academic literature.
Results: The environmental scan identified 24 {AI}-accredited programs specific to health providers, of which 11 were from the United States, 6 from Canada, 4 from the United Kingdom, and 3 from Asian countries. The most common curriculum topics across the environmental scan and scoping review included {AI} fundamentals, applications of {AI}, applied machine learning in health care, ethics, data science, and challenges to and opportunities for using {AI}.
Conclusions: Technologies are advancing more rapidly than organizations, and professionals can adopt and adapt to them. To help shape {AI} practices, health care providers must have the skills and abilities to initiate change and shape the future of their discipline and practices for advancing high-quality care within the digital ecosystem.

One of the study's research questions was whether university students from a variety of disciplines could develop a conceptual understanding of {AI} through a literacy course. We promoted this course to 4000 students and recruited 120 volunteer participants to attend and complete the 7-h course. The results of our pre-course and post-course surveys indicated that the participants made significant progress in understanding {AI} concepts, felt empowered to work with {AI}. These findings indicated that the participants of diverse study backgrounds, and of both genders, could understand the concepts of machine learning, supervised learning, regression, classification, unsupervised learning, and clustering. Prior knowledge of programming was not necessary for {AI} concepts development, and the flipped classroom learning approach enabled more flexible learning by the participants. In the future, this {AI} literacy course could be extended to include {AI} application projects and discussions of related ethical issues regarding the wider use of {AI} in society. We are planning to introduce this literacy course to senior secondary school students.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In recent years, {AI} technology has emerged as a core technology for the fourth industrial revolution. Along with the existing {SW} education, it is time to prepare for {AI} education, since the interest in {AI} education is also growing. The fact that learning about the theory and principles of {AI} is important is also stressed in the col-lege education. However, non-major students tend to perceive {AI} technology to be difficult, and hence, a more efficient {AI} education is required. The purpose of this research is to guide the learners' direction for {AI} education, helping them to break away from their fears of {AI} through the {AI} education appropriate for the learners’ level. Method: In this study, to analyze the effect of the developed educational program on the learners’ {AI} literacy, the dependent variables changed before and after the application of the program were analyzed, and the single group’s ex ante and ex post testings were applied for the designing method for inferring the causal relationship. Results: The {AI} literacy of undergraduate students was analyzed for the educational program via the ex ante and ex posts testings of a single group by operating this program. As a result of the analysis, significant results were obtained where all three areas of the {AI} literacy were improved through the educational program Conclusion: This study is meaningful in that the {AI} educational program was proposed for the liberal arts class at college for the non-majors, and that the {AI} educational program which is generally applicable for the liberal arts class was developed and directly applied to validate its effectiveness. Discussions are expected to continue to develop the various details of the {AI} basic education to ensure that the non-majors can enter the {AI} education without fearing the {AI} based on the results of this study.},

	abstract = {Today, machine learning ({ML}) technologies have penetrated almost every aspect of people’s lives, yet public understandings of these technologies are often limited. This highlights the urgent need of designing effective methods to increase people’s machine learning literacy, as the lack of relevant knowledge may result in people’s inappropriate usage of machine learning technologies. In this paper, we focus on an {ML}-assisted decision-making setting and conduct a human-subject randomized experiment to explore how providing different types of user tutorials as the machine learning literacy interventions can influence laypeople’s reliance on {ML} models, on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples. We vary the existence, interactivity and scope of the user tutorial across different treatments in our experiment. Our results show that user tutorials, when presented in appropriate forms, can help some people rely on {ML} models more appropriately. For example, for those individuals who have relatively high ability in solving the decision-making task themselves, receiving a user tutorial that is interactive and addresses the specific {ML} model to be used allows them to reduce their over-reliance on the {ML} model when they could outperform the model. In contrast, low-performing individuals’ reliance on the {ML} model is not affected by the presence or the type of user tutorial. Finally, we also find that people perceive the interactive tutorial to be more understandable and slightly more useful. We conclude by discussing the design implications of our study.},

However, it has become an equally important learning approach in contemporary education to propose a “general education” agenda that conveys instructional messages about {AI} basics and ethics, especially for those students without an engineering background. The current study proposes a situated learning design for education on this topic. Through a three-week lesson session and accompanying learning activities, the participants undertook hands-on tasks relating to {AI}. They were also afforded the opportunity to learn about the current attributes of {AI} and how these may apply to understanding {AI}-related ethical issues or problems in daily life. A pre- and post-test design was used to compare the learning effects with respect to different aspects of {AI} (e.g., {AI} understanding, cross-domain teamwork, {AI} attitudes, and {AI} ethics) among the participants. The study found a positive correlation among all the factors, as well as a strong link between {AI} understanding and attitudes on the one hand and {AI} ethics on the other. The implications of these findings are discussed, and suggestions are made for possible future revisions to current instructional design and for future research.},

	abstract = {Purpose: As a core technology of the 4th industrial revolution, artificial intelligence is rising as a crucial tech-nology for determining the competitiveness of nations and industries at a great pace. However, students who are not majoring in it have the tendency to perceive {AI} technology to be difficult, and hence, a more efficient {AI} edu-cation is needed. The purpose of this study is to present an educational program for the artificial intelligence liter-acy appropriate for the learner s level, apply it to the classroom, then explore its impact in terms of the artificial intelligence ethics. Method: In this study, an educational program for the artificial intelligence literacy which may be utilized for the non-majors using the tools of artificial intelligence has been designed. To analyze the impact of the educa-tional program conducted in this study on the learner s perception of the artificial intelligence ethics, the single group pre- and post-test which infers the causal relationship by implementing and analyzing the questionnaires on the changed perception of the artificial intelligence ethics before and after the application of the program was applied for the design method. Results: The impact of the education program for the artificial intelligence literacy on the perception of the arti-ficial intelligence ethics has been analyzed through the single group’s pre- and post-test by operating this pro-gram. As a result of the analysis, it has been verified that there was a positive change in the perception of the artificial intelligence ethics via the proposed educational program for the artificial intelligence literacy. Conclusion: In this study the impact of the educational program for the artificial intelligence literacy on the learner s perception of the artificial intelligence ethics has been analyzed by proposing and applying educational program for the artificial intelligence literacy for and in college and university liberal arts classes for the non-majors. The artificial intelligence literacy education has had a positive impact on the learner s perception of the artificial intelligence ethics. For the non-major students to fully comprehend the artificial intelligence, including the artificial intelligence ethics, an education which includes experience in the use of artificial intelligence ought to be offered beyond the classes of theory which merely convey knowledge, and towards this end, it was verified that a well structured artificial intelligence literacy education which can more than adequately offer the experiences of using and utilizing the artificial intelligence is necessary.},

In particular, the questionnaire should be deeply grounded in the existing literature on {AI} literacy, should be modular (i.e., including different facets that can be used independently of each other) to be flexibly applicable in professional life depending on the goals and use cases, and should meet psychological requirements and thus includes further psychological competencies in addition to the typical facets of {AIL}. We derived 60 items to represent different facets of {AI} Literacy according to Ng and colleagues conceptualisation of {AI} literacy and additional 12 items to represent psychological competencies such as problem solving, learning, and emotion regulation in regard to {AI}. For this purpose, data were collected online from 300 German-speaking adults. The items were tested for factorial structure in confirmatory factor analyses. The result is a measurement instrument that measures {AI} literacy with the facets Use \& apply {AI}, Understand {AI}, Detect {AI}, and {AI} Ethics and the ability to Create {AI} as a separate construct, and {AI} Self-efficacy in learning and problem solving and {AI} Self-management. This study contributes to the research on {AI} literacy by providing a measurement instrument relying on profound competency models. In addition, higher-order psychological competencies are included that are particularly important in the context of pervasive change through {AI} systems.},

Older individuals were subliminally exposed to either positive or negative aging stereotypes. Then all participants faced mathematical and verbal challenges. Those exposed to the negative aging stereotypes demonstrated a heightened cardiovascular response to stress, measured by systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate, compared with those exposed to positive aging stereotypes. The aging stereotypes appeared to influence the outcome variable of skin conductance in the same way. It appears that the negative aging stereotypes acted as direct stressors, whereas the positive aging stereotypes reduced cardiovascular stress. These findings indicate that negative aging stereotypes may contribute to adverse health outcomes in elderly persons without their awareness. The results also suggest that positive aging stereotypes could be used in interventions to reduce cardiovascular stress.},

These conditions were satisfied in the experimental design. In the first series of experiments, it was found that the subjects favoured their own group in the distribution of real rewards and penalities in a situation in which nothing but the variable of fairly irrelevant classification distinguished between the ingroup and the outgroup. In the second series of experiments it was found that: 1) maximum joint profit independent of group membership did not affect significantly the manner in which the subjects divided real pecuniary rewards; 2) maximum profit for own group did affect the distribution of rewards; 3) the clearest effect on the distribution of rewards was due to the subjects' attempt to achieve a maximum difference between the ingroup and the outgroup even at the price of sacrificing other ‘objective’ advantages. The design and the results of the study are theoretically discussed within the framework of social norms and expectations and particularly in relation to a ‘generic’ norm of outgroup behaviour prevalent in some societies.},

Since then, social identity theory has been significantly extended through a range of sub-theories that focus on social influence and group norms, leadership within and between groups, self-enhancement and uncertainty reduction motivations, deindividuation and collective behavior, social mobilization and protest, and marginalization and deviance within groups. The theory has also been applied and developed to explain organizational phenomena and the dynamics of language and speech style as identity symbols.

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) can be reliably diagnosed at 18 months, yet significant diagnostic delays persist in the United States. This double-blinded, multi-site, prospective, active comparator cohort study tested the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-based Software as a Medical Device designed to aid primary care healthcare providers ({HCPs}) in diagnosing {ASD}. The Device combines behavioral features from three distinct inputs (a caregiver questionnaire, analysis of two short home videos, and an {HCP} questionnaire) in a gradient boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm to produce either an {ASD} positive, {ASD} negative, or indeterminate output. This study compared Device outputs to diagnostic agreement by two or more independent specialists in a cohort of 18–72-month-olds with developmental delay concerns (425 study completers, 36\% female, 29\% {ASD} prevalence). Device output {PPV} for all study completers was 80.8\% (95\% confidence intervals ({CI}), 70.3\%–88.8\%) and {NPV} was 98.3\% (90.6\%–100\%). For the 31.8\% of participants who received a determinate output ({ASD} positive or negative) Device sensitivity was 98.4\% (91.6\%–100\%) and specificity was 78.9\% (67.6\%–87.7\%). The Device’s indeterminate output acts as a risk control measure when inputs are insufficiently granular to make a determinate recommendation with confidence. If this risk control measure were removed, the sensitivity for all study completers would fall to 51.6\% (63/122) (95\% {CI} 42.4\%, 60.8\%), and specificity would fall to 18.5\% (56/303) (95\% {CI} 14.3\%, 23.3\%). Among participants for whom the Device abstained from providing a result, specialists identified that 91\% had one or more complex neurodevelopmental disorders. No significant differences in Device performance were found across participants’ sex, race/ethnicity, income, or education level. For nearly a third of this primary care sample, the Device enabled timely diagnostic evaluation with a high degree of accuracy. The Device shows promise to significantly increase the number of children able to be diagnosed with {ASD} in a primary care setting, potentially facilitating earlier intervention and more efficient use of specialist resources.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies report high levels of anxiety and depression amongst adolescents. These psychiatric conditions and complex interplays of biological, social and environmental factors are important risk factors for suicidal behaviours and suicide, which show a peak in late adolescence and early adulthood. Although deaths by suicide have fallen globally in recent years, suicide deaths are increasing in some countries, such as the {US}. Suicide prevention is a challenging global public health problem. Currently, there aren’t any validated clinical biomarkers for suicidal diagnosis, and traditional methods exhibit limitations. Artificial intelligence ({AI}) is budding in many fields, including in the diagnosis of medical conditions. This review paper summarizes recent studies (past 8 years) that employed {AI} tools for the automated detection of depression and/or anxiety disorder and discusses the limitations and effects of some modalities. The studies assert that {AI} tools produce promising results and could overcome the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. Although using {AI} tools for suicidal ideation exhibits limitations, these are outweighed by the advantages. Thus, this review article also proposes extracting a fusion of features such as facial images, speech signals, and visual and clinical history features from deep models for the automated detection of depression and/or anxiety disorder in individuals, for future work. This may pave the way for the identification of individuals with suicidal thoughts.},

Pretreatment positron emission tomography ({PET}) with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ({FDG}) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy ({MRS}) may identify biomarkers for predicting remission (absence of depression).

The purpose of this study was to identify biomarkers of remission using machine learning ({ML}) with pretreatment {FDG}-{PET}/{MRS} neuroimaging, to reduce patient suffering and economic burden from ineffective trials.
Methods
This study used simultaneous {PET}/{MRS} neuroimaging from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized antidepressant trial on 60 participants with major depressive disorder ({MDD}) before initiating treatment. After eight weeks of treatment, those with ≤7 on 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were designated a priori as remitters (free of depression, 37\%). Metabolic rate of glucose uptake (metabolism) from 22 brain regions were acquired from {PET}. Concentrations ({mM}) of glutamine and glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA}) in anterior cingulate cortex were quantified from {MRS}. The data were randomly split into 67\% train and cross-validation (n=40), and 33\% test (n=20) sets. The imaging features, along with age, sex, handedness, and treatment assignment (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or {SSRI} vs. placebo) were entered into the {eXtreme} Gradient Boosting ({XGBoost}) classifier for training.
Results
In test data, the model showed 62\% sensitivity, 92\% specificity, and 77\% weighted accuracy. Pretreatment metabolism of left hippocampus from {PET} was the most predictive of remission.
Conclusions
The pretreatment neuroimaging takes around 60 minutes but has potential to prevent weeks of failed treatment trials. This study effectively addresses common issues for neuroimaging analysis, such as small sample size, high dimensionality, and class imbalance.},

	abstract = {Background: An investigation of individual-level predictors of the intention to use an {AI}-enabled feedback and a treatment recommendation tool in mental healthcare.
Objective: Using an extended {UTAUT} model to gain insight into the predictors of technology usage intentions for two specific {AI}-enabled mental healthcare tools.
Methods: A cross-sectional study included 206 psychology students and psychotherapists-in-training to examine the predictors of their intention to use two {AI}-enabled mental healthcare tools. The first tool provides feedback to the psychotherapist on their adherence to motivational interviewing techniques. The second tool uses patient voice samples to derive mood scores that the therapist may use for treatment decisions. Participants were presented with graphic depictions of the tools’ functioning mechanisms before measuring the variables of an extended {UTAUT}. Two structural equation models (one for each tool) were specified that included direct and mediated paths predicting tool usage intentions.
Results: Perceived usefulness and social influence had a positive effect on the intention to use both tools. However, trust was unrelated to usage intention for both tools. Moreover, perceived ease of use was unrelated (feedback tool) and even negatively related (treatment recommendation tool) to usage intentions when considering all predictors. In addition, a direct relationship between cognitive technology readiness and the intention to use the feedback tool, and a negative relationship between {AI} anxiety and usage intentions were observed.
Conclusions: The results shed light on general and tool-dependent drivers of {AI} technology adoption in mental healthcare. Future research may explore technological and user group characteristics that influence the adoption of {AI}-enabled tools in mental healthcare.},

There is a research gap in refocussing {AI} literacy courses from combining conceptual learning with mathematical formulae and programming codes to emphasising conceptual building from the beginning. This study fills the knowledge gap by evaluating {AI} literacy courses that aim to build conceptual understanding among university students from diverse study backgrounds. Eighty-two volunteers completed two {AI} literacy courses comprising 7 h of machine learning and 9 h of deep learning. The results of their pre- and post-course conceptual tests, surveys and self-reflective writing tasks indicated that the courses successfully equipped the participants with a conceptual understanding of {AI}. The participants felt empowered by the significant gains in their literacy and conceptual understanding of {AI}. The {AI} literacy courses successfully lower the barrier to entry for {AI} literacy and address a public need. The courses will be expanded to incorporate the development of {AI} applications together with discussion of ethical issues regarding the wide use of {AI} in society. This study can be used to guide future research on fostering {AI} literacy among educated citizens from diverse study backgrounds.},

Informal learning spaces like museums are particularly well-suited for such public science communication efforts, but there is little research investigating how to design {AI} learning experiences for these spaces. This paper explores how to design museum experiences that communicate key concepts about {AI}, using collaboration, creativity, and embodiment as inspirations for design. We present the design of five low-fidelity {AI} literacy exhibit prototypes and results from a thematic analysis of participant interactions during a co-design workshop in which family groups interacted with the prototypes and designed exhibits of their own. Our findings suggest new topics and design considerations for {AI}-related exhibits and directions for future research.},

On this note, an exploratory review was conducted to conceptualize the newly emerging concept “{AI} literacy”, in search for a sound theoretical foundation to define, teach and evaluate {AI} literacy. Grounded in literature on 18 existing peer-reviewed articles, this review proposed four aspects (i.e, know and understand, use, evaluate, and ethical issues) for fostering {AI} literacy based on the adaptation of classic literacies.

To fill this gap, this study designed and evaluated an {AI} literacy programme based on a multi-dimensional conceptual framework, which developed participants’ conceptual understanding, literacy, empowerment and ethical awareness. It emphasised conceptual building, highlighted project work in application development and initiated teaching ethics through application development. Thirty-six university students with diverse academic backgrounds joined and completed this programme, which included 7 hours on machine learning, 9 hours on deep learning and 14 hours on application development. Together with the project work, the results of the tests, surveys and reflective writings completed before and after these courses indicate that the programme successfully enhanced participants’ conceptual understanding, literacy, empowerment and ethical awareness. The programme will be extended to include more participants, such as senior secondary school students and the general public.

	abstract = {Health information technologies ({HITs}) are widely employed in healthcare and are supposed to improve quality of care and patient safety. However, so far, their implementation has shown mixed results, which might be explainable by understudied psychological factors of human–{HIT} interaction. Therefore, the present study investigates the association between the perception of {HIT} characteristics and psychological and organizational variables among 445 healthcare workers via a cross-sectional online survey in Germany. The proposed hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. The results showed that good {HIT} usability was associated with lower levels of techno-overload and lower {IT}-related strain. In turn, experiencing techno-overload and {IT}-related strain was associated with lower job satisfaction. An effective error management culture at the workplace was linked to higher job satisfaction and a slightly lower frequency of self-reported medical errors. About 69\% of surveyed healthcare workers reported making errors less frequently than their colleagues, suggesting a bias in either the perception or reporting of errors. In conclusion, the study’s findings indicate that ensuring high perceived usability when implementing {HITs} is crucial to avoiding frustration among healthcare workers and keeping them satisfied. Additionally healthcare facilities should invest in error management programs since error management culture is linked to other important organizational variables.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of artificial intelligence ({AI})–based tools in the care of individual patients and patient populations is rapidly expanding.
Objective: The aim of this paper is to systematically identify research on provider competencies needed for the use of {AI} in clinical settings.
Methods: A scoping review was conducted to identify articles published between January 1, 2009, and May 1, 2020, from {MEDLINE}, {CINAHL}, and the Cochrane Library databases, using search queries for terms related to health care professionals (eg, medical, nursing, and pharmacy) and their professional development in all phases of clinical education, {AI}-based tools in all settings of clinical practice, and professional education domains of competencies and performance. Limits were provided for English language, studies on humans with abstracts, and settings in the United States.
Results: The searches identified 3476 records, of which 4 met the inclusion criteria. These studies described the use of {AI} in clinical practice and measured at least one aspect of clinician competence. While many studies measured the performance of the {AI}-based tool, only 4 measured clinician performance in terms of the knowledge, skills, or attitudes needed to understand and effectively use the new tools being tested. These 4 articles primarily focused on the ability of {AI} to enhance patient care and clinical decision-making by improving information flow and display, specifically for physicians.
Conclusions: While many research studies were identified that investigate the potential effectiveness of using {AI} technologies in health care, very few address specific competencies that are needed by clinicians to use them effectively. This highlights a critical gap.},

	abstract = {Background: The advancement of health care information technology and the emergence of artificial intelligence has yielded tools to improve the quality of various health care processes. Few studies have investigated employee perceptions of artificial intelligence implementation in Saudi Arabia and the Arabian world. In addition, limited studies investigated the effect of employee knowledge and job title on the perception of artificial intelligence implementation in the workplace.
Objective: The aim of this study was to explore health care employee perceptions and attitudes toward the implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in health care institutions in Saudi Arabia.
Methods: An online questionnaire was published, and responses were collected from 250 employees, including doctors, nurses, and technicians at 4 of the largest hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Results: The results of this study showed that 3.11 of 4 respondents feared artificial intelligence would replace employees and had a general lack of knowledge regarding artificial intelligence. In addition, most respondents were unaware of the advantages and most common challenges to artificial intelligence applications in the health sector, indicating a need for training. The results also showed that technicians were the most frequently impacted by artificial intelligence applications due to the nature of their jobs, which do not require much direct human interaction.
Conclusions: The Saudi health care sector presents an advantageous market potential that should be attractive to researchers and developers of artificial intelligence solutions.},

	abstract = {Background: The implementation of clinical decision support systems ({CDSSs}) as an intervention to foster clinical practice change is affected by many factors. Key factors include those associated with behavioral change and those associated with technology acceptance. However, the literature regarding these subjects is fragmented and originates from two traditionally separate disciplines: implementation science and technology acceptance.
Objective: Our objective is to propose an integrated framework that bridges the gap between the behavioral change and technology acceptance aspects of the implementation of {CDSSs}.
Methods: We employed an iterative process to map constructs from four contributing frameworks—the Theoretical Domains Framework ({TDF}); the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research ({CFIR}); the Human, Organization, and Technology-fit framework ({HOT}-fit); and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology ({UTAUT})—and the findings of 10 literature reviews, identified through a systematic review of reviews approach.
Results: The resulting framework comprises 22 domains: agreement with the decision algorithm; attitudes; behavioral regulation; beliefs about capabilities; beliefs about consequences; contingencies; demographic characteristics; effort expectancy; emotions; environmental context and resources; goals; intentions; intervention characteristics; knowledge; memory, attention, and decision processes; patient–health professional relationship; patient’s preferences; performance expectancy; role and identity; skills, ability, and competence; social influences; and system quality. We demonstrate the use of the framework providing examples from two research projects.
Conclusions: We proposed {BEAR} ({BEhavior} and Acceptance {fRamework}), an integrated framework that bridges the gap between behavioral change and technology acceptance, thereby widening the view established by current models.},

	shorttitle = {From Precision Education to Precision Medicine},
	abstract = {Precision medicine has become an essential issue in the medical community as the quality of medical care is being emphasized nowadays. The technological data analysis and predictions made by Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) technologies have assisted medical staff in designing personalized medicine for patients, making {AI} technologies an important path to precision medicine. During the implementation of the new emerging technology, medical staff’s learning intentions will have a great influence on its effectiveness. With reference to the Technology Acceptance Model, this study explored medical staff’s attitudes, intentions, and relevant influencing factors in relation to {AI} application learning. A total of 285 valid questionnaires were collected. Five major factors, perceived usefulness ({PU}), perceived ease of use ({PEU}), subjective norms ({SN}), attitude towards {AI} use ({ATU}), and behavioral intention ({BI}), were used for analyzing the {AI} learning of medical staff in a hospital. Based on the {SEM} analytical results and the research model, the four endogenous constructs of {PU}, {PEU}, {SN}, and {ATU} explained 37.4\% of the changes in {BI}. In this model, {SN} and {PEU} were the determining factors of {BI}. The total effects of {SN} and {PEU} were 0.448 and 0.408 respectively, followed by {PU}, with a total effect of 0.244. As a result, the intentions of medical staff to learn to use {AI} applications to support precision medicine can be predicted by {SN}, {PEU}, {PU}, and {ATU}. Among them, subjective norms considering the influences of both supervisors and peers, such as encouragement, communication, and sharing, may assist precision education in supporting the learning attitudes and behavior regarding precision medicine. The research results can provide recommendations for examining medical staff’s intention to use {AI} applications.},

There exists a growing body of work that computationally examines this modulation in patients suffering from depression, autism, and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, the majority of the work in this area focuses on the analysis of structured speech collected in controlled environments. Here we expand on the existing literature by examining bipolar disorder ({BP}). {BP} is characterized by mood transitions, varying from a healthy euthymic state to states characterized by mania or depression. The speech patterns associated with these mood states provide a unique opportunity to study the modulations characteristic of mood variation. We describe methodology to collect unstructured speech continuously and unobtrusively via the recording of day-to-day cellular phone conversations. Our pilot investigation suggests that manic and depressive mood states can be recognized from this speech data, providing new insight into the feasibility of unobtrusive, unstructured, and continuous speech-based wellness monitoring for individuals with {BP}.},

	title = {Depression Detection from Short Utterances via Diverse Smartphones in Natural Environmental Conditions},
	abstract = {Depression is a leading cause of disease burden worldwide,
however there is an unmet need for screening and diagnostic
measures that can be widely deployed in real-world
environments. Voice-based diagnostic methods are convenient,
non-invasive to elicit, and can be collected and processed in
near real-time using modern smartphones, smart speakers, and
other devices. Studies in voice-based depression detection to
date have primarily focused on laboratory-collected voice
samples, which are not representative of typical user
environments or devices. This paper conducts the first
investigation of voice-based depression assessment techniques
on real-world data from 887 speakers, recorded using a variety
of different smartphones. Evaluations on 16 hours of speech
show that conservative segment selection strategies using
highly thresholded voice activity detection, coupled with
tailored normalization approaches are effective for mitigating
smartphone channel variability and background environmental
noise. Together, these strategies can achieve F1 scores
comparable with or better than those from a combination of
clean recordings, a single recording environment and long
utterances. The scalability of speech elicitation via smartphone
allows detailed models dependent on gender, smartphone
manufacturer and/or elicitation task. Interestingly, results
herein suggest that normalization based on these criteria may
be more effective than tailored models for detecting depressed
speech.},

	doi = {10.1109/JSTSP.2019.2949419},
	abstract = {The processing of speech as an explicit sequence of events is common in automatic speech recognition (linguistic events), but has received relatively little attention in paralinguistic speech classification despite its potential for characterizing broad acoustic event sequences. This paper proposes a framework for analyzing speech as a sequence of acoustic events, and investigates its application to depression detection. In this framework, acoustic space regions are tokenized to `words' representing speech events at fixed or irregular intervals. This tokenization allows the exploitation of acoustic word features using proven natural language processing methods. A key advantage of this framework is its ability to accommodate heterogeneous event types: herein we combine acoustic words and speech landmarks, which are articulation-related speech events. Another advantage is the option to fuse such heterogeneous events at various levels, including the embedding level. Evaluation of the proposed framework on both controlled laboratory-grade supervised audio recordings as well as unsupervised self-administered smartphone recordings highlight the merits of the proposed framework across both datasets, with the proposed landmark-dependent acoustic words achieving improvements in F1(depressed) of up to 15\% and 13\% for {SH}2-{FS} and {DAIC}-{WOZ} respectively, relative to acoustic speech baseline approaches.},
